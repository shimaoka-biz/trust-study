<details><summary>Abstract</summary>While mobile users would like to pose location-based queries such as “find me the nearest service of type S” or “find me k nearest services of type S,” they are increasingly aware of the underlying privacy concerns and threats. One of the two main approaches suggested by researchers for countering this threat involves spatial transformation via Hilbert curves. This scheme transforms a two-dimensional coordinate space into a one-dimensional space such that adjacency in the latter space implies contiguity in the former. A Trusted Server (TS) provides a Location-Based Server (LBS) with Points of Interest (POIs) indexed by the one-dimension Hilbert indices obtained by transforming their two-dimensional coordinates; mobile users query the LBS using the Hilbert index corresponding to their two-dimensional coordinates; the LBS finds the nearest Hilbert indices with appropriate POIs and returns them to the users. Owing to the large number of possible Hilbert transformations using different parameters, the attempt by an LBS to invert the transformation, i.e., compute a two-dimensional coordinate of the target user (or the POIs) is generally considered infeasible. In this paper, we ask to what extent and by which methods can a rogue LBS squeeze a privacy compromise from this scheme? We model the adversary and examine the possibilities of an attack based on semantic factors such as the distribution of POI categories and variations in POI density as well as collusion and exploitation of weaknesses in the mobile system software architecture. Finally, we point out limitations of such attacks and suggest strategies to strengthen defences against them.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The trustworthiness of cyber-physical systems that support complex collaborative business processes is an emergent property. In order to address users’ trust concerns, trustworthiness requirements of systems must be assured. In this paper, we discuss the challenges of evidence-based trustworthiness assurance in order to tackle the problem of neglecting trustworthiness requirements while developing systems. To achieve this, we propose an approach that considers trustworthiness requirements using so-called trustworthiness cases. Our trustworthiness cases will guide the system development process toward evidence-based assurance of trustworthiness. Trustworthiness cases are based on assurance cases that have been successfully applied in safety- and security-related systems. We use an application example from the health care domain to demonstrate our approach.</details>
