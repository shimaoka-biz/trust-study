<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Preserving integrity is one of the essential requirements in trusted computing. However, When it comes to system update, even with the state-of-the-art integrity management system such as OpenCIT cannot properly manage integrity. This is because the updates are not transparent to the remote attestation server and the integrity value is not updated according to the updates.This paper presents Trust Update on Linux booting, TUX. TUX collaboratively manages the integrity along with the kernel update, so that the update is transparent to the attestation server. With TUX, we can successfully maintain trust for the managed machines, even with frequent OS kernel updates. Also, TUX guarantees robust verified and measured boot to safeguard the integrity of a system’s booting process.</details>
