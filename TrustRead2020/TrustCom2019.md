<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Container technology is an emerging virtualization technology that is more efficient and lightweight than virtual machines. This technology is becoming increasingly popular. However, containers are vulnerable to attackers due to various security issues. It is necessary to build trust between users and their containers, as well as between a remote party and the container in the untrusted container environment. The existing trusted computing technologies build a trust chain from hardware to the running operating system. In this paper, we extend the trust chain to containers and build trust in the container environment. We first boot the computer to a trusted operating system. The trusted OS then verifies programs running on the OS to improve security. We design the well-formed signature list to help users to authorize container executables and modify the Linux kernel to verify executables running in containers. Therefore, the user is able to control what programs can run in his containers and trust the containers. Our approach generates a measurement list and creates a vTPM for each container. A remote party can request the measurement list based on our container state challenge protocol. As a result, a remote party is able to know the container state and decide whether to trust the container. We also implement the executables measurement and verification mechanism and evaluate the performance. The results show the container start delay is no more than 3% of the normal container start time and the overhead to measure and verify executables is no more than 1 us in most cases, which is reasonably efficient.</details>

**_Trustworthy Privacy-Preserving Service Compositions_**  
Theuermann, Kevin  
https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2019.00012  
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>E-Government applications are often composed of services provided by multiple service providers. Thus, public services must ensure accountability of performed actions to increase the trust in electronic services. Trust is crucial for user satisfaction and represents a key factor for the success of public services. Accountability is also necessary to determine an unintended behaviour of participants in service compositions. Transparent monitoring systems can facilitate the detection of failures or malicious behaviour of attackers. However, the demand for more accountability and transparency in public services arises challenges regarding the privacy of citizen's data. In this paper we propose a service composition concept providing accountability of service providers and considering privacy of sensitive data. This composition system uses proxy re-encryption in the communication protocol and cryptographically chains executed transactions. Retrospectively, citizens as well as participants of a processed service can validate the chained transactions. An implemented proof-of-concept demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed solution, which clearly supports accountability and thus increases trust in public services among citizens.</details>

**_A Unified Measurable Software Trustworthy Model Based on Vulnerability Loss Speed Index_**  
Jabeen, Gul; Ping, Luo  
https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2019.00013  
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>As trust becomes increasingly important in the software domain. Due to its complex composite concept, people face great challenges, especially in today's dynamic and constantly changing internet technology. In addition, measuring the software trustworthiness correctly and effectively plays a significant role in gaining users trust in choosing different software. In the context of security, trust is previously measured based on the vulnerability time occurrence to predict the total number of vulnerabilities or their future occurrence time. In this study, we proposed a new unified index called ""loss speed index"" that integrates the most important variables of software security such as vulnerability occurrence time, number and severity loss, which are used to evaluate the overall software trust measurement. Based on this new definition, a new model called software trustworthy security growth model (STSGM) has been proposed. This paper also aims at filling the gap by addressing the severity of vulnerabilities and proposed a vulnerability severity prediction model, the results are further evaluated by STSGM to estimate the future loss speed index. Our work has several features such as: (1) It is used to predict the vulnerability severity/type in future, (2) Unlike traditional evaluation methods like expert scoring, our model uses historical data to predict the future loss speed of software, (3) The loss metric value is used to evaluate the risk associated with different software, which has a direct impact on software trustworthiness. Experiments performed on real software vulnerability datasets and its results are analyzed to check the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed model.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>ARM TrustZone technology is widely used to provide Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) for mobile devices. However, most TEE OSes are implemented as monolithic kernels. In such designs, device drivers, kernel services and kernel modules all run in the kernel, which results in large size of the kernel. It is difficult to guarantee that all components of the kernel have no security vulnerabilities in the monolithic kernel architecture, such as the integer overflow vulnerability in Qualcomm QSEE TrustZone and the TZDriver vulnerability in HUAWEI Hisilicon TEE architecture. This paper presents MicroTEE, a TEE OS based on the microkernel architecture. In MicroTEE, the microkernel provides strong isolation for TEE OS's basic services, such as crypto service and platform key management service. The kernel is only responsible for providing core services such as address space management, thread management, and inter-process communication. Other fundamental services, such as crypto service and platform key management service are implemented as applications at the user layer. Crypto Services and Key Management are used to provide Trusted Applications (TAs) with sensitive information encryption, data signing, and platform attestation functions. Our design avoids the compromise of the whole TEE OS if only one kernel service is vulnerable. A monitor has also been added to perform the switch between the secure world and the normal world. Finally, we implemented a MicroTEE prototype on the Freescale i.MX6Q Sabre Lite development board and tested its performance. Evaluation results show that the performance of cryptographic operations in MicroTEE is better than it in Linux when the size of data is small.</details>

**_Trust and Reputation in Vehicular Networks: A Smart Contract-Based Approach_**  
Malik, Nisha; Nanda, Priyadarsi; He, Xiangjian; Liu, RenPing  
https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2019.00015  
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Appending digital signatures and certificates to messages guarantee data integrity and ensure non-repudiation, but do not identify greedy authenticated nodes. Trust evolves if some reputable and trusted node verifies the node, data and evaluates the trustworthiness of the node using an accurate metric. But, even if the verifying party is a trusted centralized party, there is opacity and obscurity in computed reputation rating. The trusted party maps it with the node's identity, but how is it evaluated and what inputs derive the reputation rating remains hidden, thus concealment of transparency leads to privacy. Besides, the malevolent nodes might collude together for defamatory actions against reliable nodes, and eventually bad mouth these nodes or praise malicious nodes collaboratively. Thus, we cannot always assume the fairness of the nodes as the rating they give to any node might not be a fair one. In this paper, we propose a smart contract-based approach to update and query the reputation of nodes, stored and maintained by IPFS distributed storage. The use case particularly deals with an emergency scenario, dealing against colluding attacks. Our scheme is implemented using MATLAB simulation. The results show how smart contracts are capable of accurately identifying trustworthy nodes and record the reputation of a node transparently and immutably.</details>

**_Optimal File Dissemination Scheduling Under a General Binary Tree of Trust Relationship_**  
Tien, Yun-Ping; Lin, Wei-Chen; Ho, Jan-Ming; Hon, Wing-Kai  
https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2019.00016  
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Ku et al. (GLOBECOM 2012) first studied the file dissemination problem under hierarchical trust relationship. They showed that when the trust relationship is defined as a rooted full binary tree, then there exists an optimal schedule for file dissemination taking ⌈log2 n⌉ rounds, where n is the total number of nodes including the source and destinations of broadcasting. Furthermore, they devised a linear-time algorithm to compute such a schedule. In this paper, we extend the file dissemination problem with the trust relationship in the form of general binary tree, i.e., each internal node is not restricted to have exactly two children. We show that an optimal schedule for file dissemination remains ⌈log2 n⌉ rounds, irrespective of the tree topology, and such a schedule can be computed in linear time. While we are extending Ku et al.'s results, our algorithm is based on a completely different approach. We have also considered the case of finding such an optimal schedule in the parallel setting, and propose an algorithm with parallel time complexity O(h log2 n), where h denotes height of the tree. Furthermore, we show that the sequential algorithm and the parallel algorithm work for the case when the trust relationship is a rooted DAG such that the out-degree of each node is bounded by two. Finally, we remark that our algorithms also produce asymptotically optimal schedules for general degree-d DAGs when d is a constant, while the problem becomes NP-hard even when the out-degree of each node in the DAG is limited to 6.</details>

**_Horcruxes for Everyone - A Framework for Key-Loss Recovery by Splitting Trust_**  
Hörandner, Felix; Rabensteiner, Christof  
https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2019.00017  
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Many modern applications require users to manage keys on their own devices, which, in case of device loss or failure, may lead to serious consequences, e.g., losing access to their Bitcoin wallet. These applications need a secure and user-friendly strategy that protects users from losing keys while preserving the keys' confidentiality. Fortunately, password-protected secret sharing (PPSS) can be used to design such a key-loss recovery strategy: It enables users to split their keys into shares, to distribute these shares across third parties and, if necessary, to recover keys via password authentication. However, deploying PPSS in a key-loss recovery strategy leaves the following practical questions unanswered: Which third parties should a user pick to diversify the trust? How can these third parties be recruited? And: How can other applications benefit from such a strategy? In this paper, we develop a framework for key-loss recovery, which allows users to distribute shares in a hierarchy that is aligned with relevant trust factors. As part of the framework, we propose a management app that supports users in building and managing hierarchical trust policies, and that offers its service to other applications. To convince organizations to operate servers, we implement our framework with a focus on server-side cost-efficiency. We extend a PPSS scheme with hierarchical trust policies, add efficient prevention of online guessing, and measure the performance of the overall system at-scale on AWS. The cost projection shows that deploying our framework is inexpensive: 40 organizations, each operating server resources for less than $20, support 50 million users when splitting and recovering their keys.</details>

**_Security and Performance Assessment of IP Multiplexing Moving Target Defence in Software Defined Networks_**  
Dishington, Cole; Sharma, Dilli P.; Kim, Dong Seong; Cho, Jin-Hee; Moore, Terrence J.; Nelson, Frederica F.  
https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2019.00046  
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>With the interconnection of services and customers, network attacks are capable of large amounts of damage. Flexible Random Virtual IP Multiplexing (FRVM) is a Moving Target Defence (MTD) technique that protects against reconnaissance and access with address mutation and multiplexing. Security techniques must be trusted, however, FRVM, along with past MTD techniques, have gaps in realistic evaluation and thorough analysis of security and performance. FRVM, and two comparison techniques, were deployed on a virtualised network to demonstrate FRVM's security and performance trade-offs. The key results include the security and performance trade-offs of address multiplexing and address mutation. The security benefit of IP address multiplexing is much greater than its performance overhead, deployed on top of address mutation. Frequent address mutation significantly increases an attackers' network scan durations as well as effectively obfuscating and hiding network configurations.</details>

**_HSDC–Net: Secure Anonymous Messaging in Online Social Networks_**  
Nosouhi, Mohammad Reza; Yu, Shui; Sood, Keshav; Grobler, Marthie  
https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2019.00054  
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Hiding contents of users' messages has been successfully addressed before, while anonymization of message senders remains a challenge since users do not usually trust ISPs and messaging application providers. To resolve this challenge, several solutions have been proposed so far. Among them, the Dining Cryptographers network protocol (DC-net) provides the strongest anonymity guarantees. However, DC-net suffers from two critical issues that makes it impractical, i.e., (1) collision possibility and (2) vulnerability against disruptions. Apart from that, we noticed a third critical issue during our investigation. (3) DC-net users can be deanonymized after they publish at least three messages. We name this problem the short stability issue and prove that anonymity is provided only for a few cycles of message publishing. As far as we know, this problem has not been identified in the previous research works. In this paper, we propose Harmonized and Stable DC-net (HSDC-net), a self-organizing protocol for anonymous communications. In our protocol design, we first resolve the short stability issue and obtain SDC-net, a stable extension of DC-net. Then, we integrate the Slot Reservation and Disruption Management sub-protocols into SDC-net to overcome the collision and security issues, respectively. The obtained HSDC-net protocol can also be integrated into blockchain-based cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin) to mix multiple transactions (belonging to different users) into a single transaction in such a way that the source of each payment is unknown. This preserves privacy of blockchain users. Our prototype implementation shows that HSDC-net achieves low latencies that makes it a practical protocol.</details>

**_Trustworthy Distributed Computations on Personal Data Using Trusted Execution Environments_**  
Ladjel, Riad; Anciaux, Nicolas; Pucheral, Philippe; Scerri, Guillaume  
https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2019.00058  
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Thanks to new regulations like GDPR, Personal Data Management Systems (PDMS) have become a reality. This decentralized way of managing personal data provides a de facto protection against massive attacks on central servers. But, when performing distributed computations, this raises the question of how to preserve individuals' trust on their PDMS? And how to guarantee the integrity of the final result? This paper proposes a secure computing framework capitalizing on the use of Trusted Execution Environments at the edge of the network to tackle these questions.</details>

**_Privacy-Preserving Outsourcing Computation of QR Decomposition in the Encrypted Domain_**  
Zhang, Yonghong; Zheng, Peijia; Luo, Weiqi  
https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2019.00059  
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Signal processing in encrypted domain has become an important mean to protect privacy in an untrusted network environment. Due to the limitations of the underlying encryption methods, many useful algorithms that are sophisticated are not well implemented. Considering that QR decomposition is widely used in many fields, in this paper, we propose to implement QR decomposition in homomorphic encrypted domain. We firstly realize some necessary primitive operations in homomorphic encrypted domain, including division and open square operation. Gram-Schmidt process is then studied in the encrypted domain. We propose the implementation of QR decomposition in the encrypted domain by using the secure implementation of Gram-Schmidt process. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and analyze the performance of the proposed outsourced QR decomposition.</details>

**_A Probability Prediction Based Mutable Control-Flow Attestation Scheme on Embedded Platforms_**  
Hu, Jianxing; Huo, Dongdong; Wang, Meilin; Wang, Yazhe; Zhang, Yan; Li, Yu  
https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2019.00077  
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Control-flow attacks cause powerful threats to the software integrity. Remote attestation for control flow is a crucial security service for ensuring the software integrity on embedded platforms. The fine-grained remote control-flow attestation with execution-profiling Control-Flow Graph (CFG) is applied to defend against control-flow attacks. It is a safe scheme but it may influence the runtime efficiency. In fact, we find out only the vulnerable parts of a program need being attested at costly fine-grained level to ensure the security, and the remaining normal parts just need a lightweight coarse-grained check to reduce the overhead. We propose Mutable Granularity Control-Flow Attestation (MGC-FA) scheme, which bases on a probabilistic model, to distinguish between the vulnerable and normal parts in the program and combine fine-grained and coarse-grained control-flow attestation schemes. MGC-FA employs the execution-profiling CFG to apply the remote control-flow attestation scheme on embedded devices. MGC-FA is implemented on Raspberry Pi with ARM TrustZone and the experimental results show its effect on balancing the relationship between runtime efficiency and control-flow security.</details>

**_A Logic for Secure Stratified Systems and its Application to Containerized Systems_**  
Lauer, Hagen; Sakzad, Amin; Rudolph, Carsten; Nepal, Surya  
https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2019.00081  
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present the design and verification of a secure integrity measurement system for containerized systems. Containerization of applications allows fine-graded deployment and management of services and dependencies but also needs fine-graded security mechanisms. In this paper we provide formal abstractions for containerized systems by introducing LS3, a formal model and logic with sub-domain constructs to represent stratified systems and their interactions. Using our formal model, we prove that the widely used Trusted Computing Group (TCG) based Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) securely extends trust measurements from boot to applications. However, IMA is not designed to make domain specific trust measurements and is consequently incapable of creating domain specific integrity reports. Current research aims to improve either trust measurement performance or comprehensiveness but does not improve the measurement function and its semantics to allow remote verification of measurements per domain. We present an enhanced trust measurement architecture design, which produces domain specific integrity measurements suitable for fine-graded remote attestation. Providing domain specific integrity reports eases system and sub-system verification and yields desirable properties such as measurement log stability and constrained disclosure for multi-domain systems. We verify and prove the correctness of our trust measurement architecture using our formal model.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>E-voting plays a significant role in social activities. The trust of the voting results and the privacy of each voter are always the most important concerns in designing secure e-voting system. In this paper, we design a decentralized trustless e-voting system based on the smart contract. To guarantee the correctness of the voting result, the smart contract on Blockchain is used to provide a trusted public bulletin board and trusted computing environment. To hide the identity of each voter as well as avoid multiple voting, linkable ring signature is used for each voter to group a signing ring. In addition, to make sure that all voters will see the voting result at the same time, or nobody can get it, threshold encryption without trusted third party is used to make secret-key secretly before tally stage. Moreover, the trust (power) of the voting system is separated to all voters. Even though some of them are malicious, the final result will not be influenced. The contract is deployed on the Ethereum private network. Some feasibility and cost analysis on money and time are also provided.</details>

**_A Secure Private Charging Pile Sharing Scheme with Electric Vehicles in Energy Blockchain_**  
Wang, Yuntao; Su, Zhou; Zhang, Kuan  
https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2019.00092  
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>With the rapid advance of electric vehicles (EVs) and the sparse public charging infrastructure, the private charging pile sharing networks (PCPSNs) hold the potential to improve the quality of experience (QoE) of using EVs by leveraging private charging piles (PCPs) as shared charging points to charge a group of distributed EVs. However, due to the potential security and privacy issues for EVs and PCPs caused by untrusted participants in decentralized energy market, it becomes a crucial challenge to optimally schedule the charging and sharing strategies of EVs and PCPs in PCPSNs. In this paper, we propose a secure and permissioned blockchain-based PCP sharing scheme for EVs in PCPSNs. Firstly, we present an energy blockchain-based PCPSN framework to enhance the security of distributed energy trading. Secondly, we develop a reputation-based secure PCP sharing protocol to efficiently reach consensus in the blockchain with the implement of BLS multi-signature. Thirdly, we investigate a distributed reputation model to evaluate the trustworthiness of participants and identify malicious users. In addition, based on the many-to-one matching game, the optimal strategies of EVs and PCPs are analyzed by searching the stable matching pairs. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed scheme can not only improve the QoE of users, but also protect the network from adversaries.</details>

**_Measuring Trustworthiness of IoT Image Sensor Data Using Other Sensors’ Complementary Multimodal Data_**

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Trust of image sensor data is becoming increasingly important as the Internet of Things (IoT) applications grow from home appliances to surveillance. Up to our knowledge, there exists only one work in literature that estimates trustworthiness of digital images applied to forensic applications, based on a machine learning technique. The efficacy of this technique is heavily dependent on availability of an appropriate training set and adequate variation of IoT sensor data with noise, interference and environmental condition, but availability of such data cannot be assured always. Therefore, to overcome this limitation, a robust method capable of estimating trustworthy measure with high accuracy is needed. Lowering cost of sensors allow many IoT applications to use multiple types of sensors to observe the same event. In such cases, complementary multimodal data of one sensor can be exploited to measure trust level of another sensor data. In this paper, for the first time, we introduce a completely new approach to estimate the trustworthiness of an image sensor data using another sensor's numerical data. We develop a theoretical model using the Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) framework. The efficacy of the proposed model in estimating trust level of an image sensor data is analyzed by observing a fire event using IoT image and temperature sensor data in a residential setup under different scenarios. The proposed model produces highly accurate trust level in all scenarios with authentic and forged image data.</details>

**_Differentially Private Streaming to Untrusted Edge Servers in Intelligent Transportation System_**  
Ghane Ezabadi, Soheila; Jolfaei, Alireza; Kulik, Lars; Kotagiri, Ramamohanarao  
https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2019.00113  
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>This paper considers the privacy issues in the intelligent transportation system, in which the data is largely communicated based upon vehicle-to-infrastructure and vehicle-to-vehicle protocols. The sensory data communicated by the vehicles contain sensitive information, such as location and speed, which could violate the driver's privacy if they are leaked with no perturbation. Recent studies suggested mechanisms for randomizing the stream of vehicular data to ensure individuals' privacy. Although the past works on differential privacy provide a strong privacy guarantee, they are limited to applications where communication parties are trusted and/or data is limited to a few types. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a differentially private mechanism that adds noise in the user side rather than the server. Also, our mechanism is able to perturb various types of data as pointed out by the dedicated short-range communication protocols in the automotive industry. The proposed mechanism is data adaptive and scales the noise with respect to the data type and distribution. Our extensive experiments show the accuracy of our mechanism compared to the recent approaches.</details>

https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2019.00114  
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) play an essential role in ensuring safe, reliable and faster transportation with the help of an Intelligent Transportation system. The trustworthiness of vehicles in VANETs is extremely important to ensure the authenticity of messages and traffic information transmitted in extremely dynamic topographical conditions where vehicles move at high speed. False or misleading information may cause substantial traffic congestions, road accidents and may even cost lives. Many approaches exist in literature to measure the trustworthiness of GPS data and messages of an Autonomous Vehicle (AV). To the best of our knowledge, they have not considered the trustworthiness of other On-Board Unit (OBU) components of an AV, along with GPS data and transmitted messages, though they have a substantial relevance in overall vehicle trust measurement. In this paper, we introduce a novel model to measure the overall trustworthiness of an AV considering four different OBU components additionally. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated with a traffic simulation model developed by Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) using realistic traffic data and considering different levels of uncertainty.</details>

https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2019.00115  
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The paper considers data security issues in vehicle-to-infrastructure communications, where vehicles stream data to a road side unit. We assume aggregated data in road side units can be stored or used for data analytics. In this environment, there are issues in regards to the scalability of key management and computation limitations at the edge of the network. To address these issues, we suggest the formation of groups in the vehicle layer, where a group leader is assigned to communicate with group devices and the road side unit. We propose a lightweight permutation mechanism for preserving the confidentiality of sensory data.</details>

Awaysheh, Feras; Cabaleiro, José Carlos; Pena, Tomás Fernández; Alazab, Mamoun  
https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2019.00117  
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Many technological cases exploiting data science have been realized in recent years; machine learning, Internet of Things, and stream data processing are examples of this trend. Other advanced applications have focused on capturing the value from streaming data of different objects of transport and traffic management in an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). In this context, security control and trust level play a decisive role in the sustainable adoption of this trend. However, conceptual work integrating the security approaches of different disciplines into one coherent reference architecture is limited. The contribution of this paper is a reference architecture for ITS security (called SITS). In addition, a classification of Big Data technologies, products, and services to address the ITS trust challenges is presented. We also proposed a novel multi-tier ITS security framework for validating the usability of SITS with business intelligence development in the enterprise domain.</details>
