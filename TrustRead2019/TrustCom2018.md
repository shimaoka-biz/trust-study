**_Engineering Trust: A Graph-Based Algorithm for Modeling, Validating, and Evaluating Trust_**  
Tucker, S.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Trust is an important topic in today's interconnected world. Breaches of trust in today's systems has had profound effects upon us all, and they are very difficult and costly to fix especially when caused by flaws in the system's architecture. Trust modeling can expose these types of issues, but modeling trust in complex multi-tiered system architectures can be very difficult. Often experts have differing views of trust and how it applies to systems within their domain. This work presents a graph-based modeling methodology that normalizes the application of trust across disparate system domains allowing the modeling of complex intersystem trust relationships. An algorithm is proposed that applies graph theory to model, validate and evaluate trust in system architectures. Also, it provides the means to apply metrics to compare and prioritize the effectiveness of trust management in system and component architectures. The results produced by the algorithm can be used in conjunction with systems engineering processes to ensure both trust and the efficient use of resources.</details>

**_A Novel Dynamic Cloud Service Trust Evaluation Model in Cloud Computing_**  
Wang, Y.; Wen, J.; Zhou, W.; Luo, F.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>There are many different types of cloud services. How to choose the best cloud service for a specific application is a challenging issue. Using cloud services, users' private data could be exposed to a third party, which might not be trusted. In this paper, a dynamic cloud service trust evaluation model is proposed based on service-level agreement (SLA) and privacy-awareness. First, to make the final trust evaluation value more practical, the proposed model performs a comprehensive trust evaluation, which consists of direct, indirect, and reputation trust. Second, cloud services are divided into five levels based on their service capabilities. By analyzing SLA to determine the quality of service, the user can choose a suitable SLA. In order to protect data security of the cloud service user, we propose a data protection method based on a normal cloud model. Finally, we propose a dynamic trust update mechanism to update the direct trust. Experimental results based on a public dataset show that the proposed model effectively identifies the user community based on service preferences, improves the service requester's satisfaction, avoids malicious interference, and is accurate and feasible.</details>

**_One Secure Access Scheme Based on Trusted Execution Environment_**  
Fan, Y.; Liu, S.; Tan, G.; Lin, X.; Zhao, G.; Bai, J.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The wide adoption of mobile devices poses an imminent threat to preserving privacy. In order to prevent the leakage of sensitive information (such as the contact list, or private pictures) raised by inappropriate access, we propose a secure access scheme based on Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) specifically designed for mobile devices. The proposed scheme has two purposes: secure access and minimizing losses. For secure access, we use TEE to run access authorization and verification; for minimizing losses, we use the strategy of file slice to divide the sensitive file into multiple parts and then encrypt the file parts respectively in case of large-scale leakage. Practically, our scheme's </details>

**_Evaluation of Flexilink as Deterministic Unified Real-Time Protocol for Industrial Networks_**  
Ma, T.; Hu, W.; Wang, Y.; El-Banna, D.; Grant, J.; Dai, H.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The QoS of real-time network based on the traditional TCP/IP architecture is always perceived as a dilemma. The current real-time network design is trade-off between different network performances such as delay, packet loss, and trans-mission speed. We believe the traditional network architecture becomes a barrier of deterministic network performance. Time deterministic networking is demanded by some applications such as industrial control network, aviation, and interactive multime-dia. In addition, it is important to guarantee the data integrity and timing accuracy even when the network is congested. This paper proposed a scheduling model for Flexilink which is a newly proposed dynamic TDM network protocol and architecture that is approved to be secure and stable. We compared proposed scheduling algorithm for Flexilink in comparison with classic best effort network and priority based network using simulation. The experiments results show that the proposed scheduling algorithm performs very stable even when the network is heavily loaded.</details>

**_Understanding Trust, Privacy and Financial Fears in Online Payment_**  
Haddad, G. El; Aïmeur, E.; Hage, H.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In online payment, customers must transmit their personal and financial information through the website to conclude their purchase and pay the services or items selected. They may face possible fears from online transactions raised by their risk perception about financial or privacy loss. They may have concerns over the payment decision with the possible negative behaviors such as shopping cart abandonment. Therefore, customers have three major players that need to be addressed in online payment: the online seller, the payment page, and their own perception. However, few studies have explored these three players in an online purchasing environment. In this paper, we focus on the customer concerns and examine the antecedents of trust, payment security perception as well as their joint effect on two fundamentally important customers' aspects privacy concerns and financial fear perception. A total of 392 individuals participated in an online survey. The results highlight the importance, of the seller website's components (such as ease of use, security signs, and quality information) and their impact on the perceived payment security as well as their impact on customer's trust and financial fear perception. The objective of our study is to design a research model that explains the factors contributing to an online payment decision.</details>

**_DecentID: Decentralized and Privacy-Preserving Identity Storage System Using Smart Contracts_**  
Friebe, S.; Sobik, I.; Zitterbart, M.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Many Internet services require the registration of an account before permitting use of their services. Over time, many Internet users end up with a multitude of accounts with separated identities. A solution to this problem is offered by single-sign-on (SSO) providers, where a user can create a single identity and use this identity for multiple services. However it requires the user to trust the SSO provider. When the provider blocks access to the identities the users lose access to their subscribed services. To avoid this problem, we propose DecentID, a completely decentralized identity storage system that does not require a centralized trusted third party. Instead, a public blockchain is used as trust anchor. Identities can be created and used for different services. Each service can only read the identity attributes disclosed for it without being able to read attributes the user wants to keep secret.</details>

**_Reputation Prediction Using Influence Conversion_**  
Rakoczy, M. E.; Bouzeghoub, A.; Gancarski, A. Lopes; Wegrzyn-Wolska, K.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Currently, due to constantly increasing popularity of social media sites and thus increasing amounts of data available to study, the field of social computing has gained momentum. The research about human interactions in social networks have proven to have multiple usages in e-commerce, recommendation and others. Amongst studied topics, notions of trustworthiness and influence drawn much attention in recent years. However, these notions were studied separately and independently, with little focus on the fact that, in real life, they tend to exist simultaneously. In this paper, we focus on this novel problem and present an investigation of both influence and reputation. In particular, we propose a transition method, that uses existing influence information from social network in order to predict the collective trustworthiness of the node, or reputation. Through preliminary experiments on a real-world dataset, we demonstrate the suitability of our method.</details>

**_Repoxy: Replication Proxy for Trustworthy SDN Controller Operation_**  
Azab, M.; Hamdy, A.; Mansour, A.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Software Defined Networks (SDN) is envisaged as a future model for large-scale, elastic, and adaptive networks. However, such flexibility comes with a major cost. Relying heavily on software across the entire architecture and the centralized nature of the most important component, the controller, gave the attackers asymmetric advantage. for decades, we used to build security tools to secure the network traffic, but network components security was always protected by physical perimeters behind doors. In this paper, we present REPlication prOXY(Repoxy), a smart gateway isolating the north and southbound to enhance controller resilience, availability, and reliability in presence of attacks and also discuss our first version of the implementation. Repoxy presents a novel SDN-controller intrusion detection system to detect any malicious manipulations to the controller software. Further, Repoxy enables elasticity and high-availability for SDN controllers by facilitating southbound-oblivious seamless multi-controller replication, and handover for same network traffic. Additionally, Repoxy helps forensic analysts to easily find attack traces by exploiting Repoxy's information-rich database logging all the switch controller interactions. Results and evaluations showed the enhanced trustworthiness in the SDN network with a reasonable overhead when Repoxy is used.</details>

**_A Dynamic Trust Weight Allocation Technique for Data Reconstruction in Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks_**  
Aleman, C. Sanchez; Pissinou, N.; Alemany, S.; Kamhoua, G.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Data accuracy and low energy consumption in mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSN) are crucial attributes for real-time applications. Although there are many existing methods to reconstruct data for wireless sensor networks, there are few developed for highly mobile environments. We propose Dynamic Trust Weight Allocation Technique (DTWA), a novel in-network data reconstruction method that determines the trust level in the data accuracy of each candidate node by evaluating spatio-temporal correlations, trajectory behavior, quantity and quality of data, and the number of hops traveled by the received data from the source. DTWA is capable of evaluating second-hand data when there is no first-hand data available and selecting second-hand data when this last is more accurate than the first-hand data. Our results demonstrate that data reconstructed using DTWA depicts significantly lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) compared to the IMC method when tested for both low and high incomplete dataset scenarios.</details>

**_Encrypted Domain Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient and Fragile Audio Watermarking_**  
Chen, J.; Chen, Z.; Zheng, P.; Guo, J.; Zhang, W.; Huang, J.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Audio has become increasingly important in modern social communication and mobile Internet, e.g., the employment of voice messaging in mobile social Apps. In the scenario of cloud computing, we need to consider the privacy protection of the audio content and the integrity of the audio simultaneously. In this paper, we study the application of an encrypted audio fragile watermarking in a privacy-preserving audio authentication system in the cloud. We firstly implement the computation of Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient in the encrypted domain (MFCC-ED) with additive homomorphic encryption. By performing MFCC-ED on the encrypted audio, we extract an encrypted fragile watermark message. The encrypted fragile watermark is then embedding into the encrypted discrete wavelet transform domain. Our experimental results show that the proposed watermarked scheme is fragile that is sensitive to common audio attacks. We also present the localization method that is able to well localize the temper positions.</details>

**_TARAS: Trust-Aware Role-Based Access Control System in Public Internet-of-Things_**  
Gwak, B.; Cho, J.; Lee, D.; Son, H.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Due to the proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) environments, humans working with heterogeneous, smart objects in public IoT environments become more popular than ever before. This situation often requires to establish trust relationships between a user and a smart object for their secure interactions, but without the presence of prior interactions. In this work, we are interested in how a smart object can grant an access right to a human user in the absence of any prior knowledge in which some users may be malicious aiming to breach security goals of the IoT system. To solve this problem, we propose a trust-aware, role-based access control system, namely TARAS, which provides adaptive authorization to users based on dynamic trust estimation. In TARAS, for the initial trust establishment, we take a multidisciplinary approach by adopting the concept of I-sharing from psychology. The I-sharing follows the rationale that people with similar roles and traits are more likely to respond in a similar way. This theory provides a powerful tool to quickly establish trust between a smart object and a new user with no prior interactions. In addition, TARAS can adaptively filter malicious users out by revoking their access rights based on adaptive, dynamic trust estimation. Our experimental results show that the proposed TARAS mechanism can maximize system integrity in terms of correctly detecting malicious or benign users while maximizing service availability to users particularly when the system is fine-tuned based on the identified optimal setting in terms of an optimal trust threshold.</details>

**_A Privacy-Preserving Multipurpose Watermarking Scheme for Audio Authentication and Protection_**  
Chen, J.; Zheng, P.; Guo, J.; Zhang, W.; Huang, J.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In the scenario of cloud computing, it is necessary to consider the privacy protection of the audio content as well as copyright protection and content authentication simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an encrypted audio multipurpose watermarking scheme based on cloud storage and computing. We firstly perform encrypted domain discrete wavelet transform on the encrypted audio to obtain encrypted coefficients. By using the spread spectrum method, we embed the robust and the fragile watermarks into different sub-bands. We then propose algorithms to extract the robust and the fragile watermarks from the encrypted watermarked audio. Some experiments are conducted to verify the validity and feasibility of the proposed scheme. The results show that the proposed scheme has good performances of robustness, fragility, and tamper location.</details>

**_Dynamic Survivable Path Routing for Fast Changing IoT Network Topologies_**  
Elappila, M.; Chinara, S.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>IoT is the main enabling factor of the promising future communication networks. Several identification and tracking technologies, wireless sensor and actuator networks, distributed intelligence and other enhanced communication techniques are put together to establish IoT framework. Communication protocols and routing strategies in these mesh-like sensor networks should be carefully designed to cope up with the fast changing nature of the topology. This paper tries to propose a protocol in the real time network where the traffic is more and also congested by so many data sources sending their packets to the base station at the same time. The protocol selects the path with a high survivability factor at the same time it should try to select the one which has less interference from the other nodes as well as the environment. For selecting the next hop node, our algorithm uses a criterion which is a function of the signal-to-interference-noise-ratio of the link between those two, survivability factor of the path from that node to the destination, and the path loss distance from that node to the destination.</details>

**_BARS: A Blockchain-Based Anonymous Reputation System for Trust Management in VANETs_**  
Lu, Z.; Wang, Q.; Qu, G.; Liu, Z.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The public key infrastructure (PKI) based authentication protocol provides the basic security services for vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). However, trust and privacy are still open issues due to the unique characteristics of vehicles. It is crucial for VANETs to prevent internal vehicles from broadcasting forged messages while simultaneously protecting the privacy of each vehicle against tracking attacks. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based anonymous reputation system (BARS) to break the linkability between real identities and public keys to preserve privacy. The certificate and revocation transparency is implemented efficiently using two blockchains. We design a trust model to improve the trustworthiness of messages relying on the reputation of the sender based on both direct historical interactions and indirect opinions about the sender. Experiments are conducted to evaluate BARS in terms of security and performance and the results show that BARS is able to establish distributed trust management, while protecting the privacy of vehicles.</details>

**_Turning Trust Around: Smart Contract-Assisted Public Key Infrastructure_**  
Ahmed, A. S.; Aura, T.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In past, several Certificate Authority (CA) compromise and subsequent mis-issue of certificate raise the importance of certificate transparency and dynamic trust management for certificates. Certificate Transparency (CT) provides transparency for issued certificates, thus enabling corrective measure for a mis-issued certificate by a CA. However, CT and existing mechanisms cannot convey the dynamic trust state for a certificate. To address this weakness, we propose Smart Contract-assisted PKI (SCP) - a smart contract based PKI extension - to manage dynamic trust network for PKI. SCP enables distributed trust in PKI, provides a protocol for managing dynamic trust, assures trust state of a certificate, and provides a better trust experience for end-users.</details>

**_N-Combat: A Nuisance Call Combating Framework for Internet Telephony_**  
Javed, I.; Toumi, K.; Crespi, N.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Nuisance calls are not only irritating and annoying but also pose several security threats. Nuisance calls can be classified into live, recorded, scam and silent spam calls. Unlike traditional communication networks, users identities over the web cannot be asserted as they are created without any subscription contract or identification proof. To address this issue, we present N-Combat framework that effectively combats automated and manually generated nuisance calls over web communication services. In N-Combat the caller's reputation is computed using total call duration, out-degree, feedback received and the reliability of communicating participants. To address the dynamic behavior of callers, the concept of a dual time window is introduced. Furthermore, the framework uses a watchdog mechanism to combat whitewashing attacks that allows spammers to shed their bad reputation and reenter the network with a new identity.</details>

**_A Comprehensive Analysis of Packet Loss in MANETs_**  
Khan, M. S.; Waris, S.; Ahmed, I.; Khan, M. I.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Security schemes proposed for for Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) based on node's trust computation consider packet drop as a sign of misbehaving from malicious nodes. However, this may not be always true because of node mobility and limited processing capability feature of nodes in MANETs. As nodes are free to move in MANETs, packet loss may occur due to node mobility, non-availability of next hop nodes, and so on. Moreover, due to frequent data from multiple sources, a forwarding node queue may overflow that causes packet loss. Furthermore, packet loss may also occur due to congestion in the network. To better overcome the packet loss problem discussed previously, the packet loss possible reasons should be analyzed comprehensively in all aspect and then propose a counter strategy against each packet loss reason. In this paper, we analyze the reasons behind packet loss in MANETs comprehensively under different network scenarios. Moreover, we investigate the effect of different network parameters, such as mobility, data rate, and congestion on packet loss. One of the main contributions of this paper is to analyze the causes of packet drop comprehensively in MANETs. This work provides detailed insights in selecting the proper parameters to analyze the behavior of nodes in the network in different context. Moreover, this work also provides help in the design of trust-based security schemes to detect and isolate true malicious nodes in the network.</details>

**_Trust4App: Automating Trustworthiness Assessment of Mobile Applications_**  
Habib, S. M.; Alexopoulos, N.; Islam, M. M.; Heider, J.; Marsh, S.; Müehlhäeuser, M.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Smartphones have become ubiquitous in our everyday lives, providing diverse functionalities via millions of applications (apps) that are readily available. To achieve these functionalities, apps need to access and utilize potentially sensitive data, stored in the user's device. This can pose a serious threat to users' security and privacy, when considering malicious or underskilled developers. While application marketplaces, like Google Play store and Apple App store, provide factors like ratings, user reviews, and number of downloads to distinguish benign from risky apps, studies have shown that these metrics are not adequately effective. The security and privacy health of an application should also be considered to generate a more reliable and transparent trustworthiness score. In order to automate the trustworthiness assessment of mobile applications, we introduce the Trust4App framework, which not only considers the publicly available factors mentioned above, but also takes into account the Security and Privacy (S&P) health of an application. Additionally, it considers the S&P posture of a user, and provides an holistic personalized trustworthiness score. While existing automatic trustworthiness frameworks only consider trustworthiness indicators (e.g. permission usage, privacy leaks) individually, Trust4App is, to the best of our knowledge, the first framework to combine these indicators. We also implement a proof-of-concept realization of our framework and demonstrate that Trust4App provides a more comprehensive, intuitive and actionable trustworthiness assessment compared to existing approaches.</details>

**_Bionic Mechanism Based Dynamic Trust Evaluation Method in Cloud Environment_**  
Ma, S.; Shuai, X.; Zhou, Z.; Qiao, K.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In cloud environments, trust is one of the most important tools to enhance security. Trust can improve the reliability of cloud computing resources and has an important role in the business environments. In this paper, trust in cloud environment is regarded as a self-organizing system, using bionic mechanism, a dynamic trust evaluation method with family attribute is proposed. In this method, factors of trust evaluation include time, IP and behavior feedback. Data structure of access record table and trust record table are designed to store the relationship between ancestor nodes and descendant nodes. Based on trust information of the current node's ancestors, the biological evolution process is simulated. In order to minimize the influence of joint fraud on trust evaluation, the connected graph of ancestor nodes is constructed to evaluate the comprehensive trust of the node? which is converted to TSP problem and the optimal sequence of ancestor nodes is got by ant colony algorithm. The influence weight of ancestor node's trust on the current node's trust evaluation is denoted by the geometric sequence, and each factor's trust evaluation value of the current node is calculated. According to each factor's average weight of ancestor nodes, the comprehensive trust value of the current node is calculated. The simulation result shows that the trust evaluation method based on bionic mechanism is effective, and trust evaluation process of the current node can be regarded as comprehensive application of the ancestors' trust information, and the optimal trust sequence is searched. With increasing of ancestor nodes' trust information, the trust evaluation result is more accurate, which can effectively solve the joint fraud problem.</details>

**_A Universal Secret Sharing Scheme with General Access Structure Based on CRT_**  
Meng, K.; Miao, F.; Yu, Y.; Lu, C.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In a (t, n) threshold secret sharing ((t, n)-SS) scheme, any equal to or more than t shareholders are able to reconstruct the secret by pooling shares together. However, (t, n)-SS cannot work when the access structure is not threshold. Later, the notion of secret sharing scheme with general access structure (GAS) was proposed. In a GAS scheme, access structure can be designed for any requirements. If and only if a set of shareholders satisfies required access structure, the secret can be recovered. Because access structures are more complex than simple (t, n) threshold, users need plenty of storage to keep multiple private shares in most GAS schemes. In order to reduce private shares of shareholder, this paper proposes a universal GAS scheme which breaks the hierarchical limitation of levels in a multilevel secret sharing scheme based on Chinese remainder theorem to make the GAS scheme available for any general access structure. More importantly, each shareholder just needs less storage to keep one private share in the proposed scheme.</details>

**_ESRQ: An Efficient Secure Routing Method in Wireless Sensor Networks Based on Q-Learning_**  
Liu, G.; Wang, X.; Li, X.; Hao, J.; Feng, Z.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Some trust-based methods have been proposed for consideration by guaranteeing the security routing of wireless sensor networks (WSN) recently. However, Most of the current research work usually consumes a lot of energy resources and computing resources or only performs well for specific types of attacks. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and efficient security routing method by combining the trust mechanism with q-learning algorithm. The sensor node determines the credibility of the specific node autonomously and efficiently according to the performance of the behavior of the node. The results show that 1) this method provides a more secure routing mechanism and it can effectively deal with many kinds of attacks; and 2) the method is lightweight and reliable, it provides better energy/packet delivery tradeoff performance compared with other existing trust-based methods and can cope with different conditions.</details>

**_Trust-Based Dynamic Linear Threshold Models for Non-competitive and Competitive Influence Propagation_**  
Caliò, A.; Tagarelli, A.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>What are the key-features that enable an information diffusion model to explain the inherent dynamic, and often competitive, nature of real-world propagation phenomena? In this paper we aim to answer this question by proposing a novel class of diffusion models, inspired by the classic Linear Threshold model, and built around the following aspects: trust/distrust in the user relationships, which is leveraged to model different effects of social influence on the decisions taken by an individual; changes in adopting one or alternative information items; hesitation towards adopting an information item over time; latency in the propagation; time horizon for the unfolding of the diffusion process; and multiple cascades of information that might occur competitively. To the best of our knowledge, the above aspects have never been unified into the same LT-based diffusion model. We also define different strategies for the selection of the initial influencers to simulate non-competitive and competitive diffusion scenarios, particularly related to the problem of limitation of misinformation spread. Results on publicly available networks have shown the meaningfulness and uniqueness of our models.</details>

**_Securing the Internet of Things (IoT): A Security Taxonomy for IoT_**  
Rizvi, S.; Kurtz, A.; Pfeffer, J.; Rizvi, M.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In Internet of Things (IoT), there is a vast number of connected devices that exist. These devices are collecting and transmitting great volumes of data from device to device, device to enterprise systems, and occasionally from device to humans. Due to the billions of connected devices, there is a great risk of identity and data theft, device manipulation, data falsification, server/network manipulation, and subsequent impact to application platforms. While the number of these interconnected devices continues to grow every day, so does the number of security threats and vulnerabilities posed to these devices. Security is one of the most paramount technological research problems that exist today for IoT. Security has many facets - security built within the device, security of data transmission, and data storage within the systems and its applications. There is an extensive amount of literature that exists on the subject with countless problems as well as proposed solutions; however, most of the existing work does not provide a holistic view of security and data privacy issues within the IoT. The primary goal of this research work is to advance the current state of the art in IoT research by identifying (a) the critical domains where IoT is heavily used, (b) the security requirements and challenges that IoT is currently facing, and (c) the existing security solutions that have been proposed or implemented with their limitations.</details>

**_A Trust Energy-Efficient QoS Routing Scheme for Mobile Peer-to-Peer Networks_**  
Qu, D.; Liang, D.; Wu, S.; Li, J.; Xuan, W.; Wang, X.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Due to the ubiquitous use of wireless communication and enormous success of peer-to-peer (P2P) mode in wired networks, mobile P2P network (MP2P) attracts increasing attentions. However, the selfishness of nodes caused by the P2P mode, the scarcity of resources, and the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of various network applications make it difficult to design an appropriate routing scheme. Thus, in this paper, we propose a trust energy-efficient QoS routing scheme in MP2P. We evaluate a routing path from three different aspects, namely, trust, energy consumption and QoS respectively. We apply interval forms to denote the network states and application requirements respectively for their difficulty to obtain and describe accurately, and calculate their matching by probability model and satisfaction degree as the evaluation value of a link. Then a heuristic routing protocol is proposed to find satisfied routing paths. Results from simulation experiments demonstrate that our proposed scheme has a better performance.</details>

**_Testing Sequence Generation Method Based on Unrelated Behaviors Serializing_**  
Sun, T.; Guo, X.; Zhang, T.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>With the development of science and technology, many systems contain a lot of concurrency behaviors in the software. The uncertainty of the order in which concurrent behaviors occur poses a great challenge to software testing. The Colored Petri Net (CPN) model can accurately describe the concurrent behaviors in the software and can also be used to test the concurrent system software. However, the great problem of CPN model is state space explosion. In order to solve the problem, this paper proposes an unrelated concurrent behaviors serializing algorithm. The tester divide transitions in CPN model into three categories: the tested behaviors, the related behaviors and the unrelated behaviors. After that the algorithm will automatically implement inhibitor arcs addition in CPN model, so as to realize the serialization of unrelated concurrent behaviors. The algorithm can not only simplify the structure of the state space, but also achieve the goal of preventing the state space explosion finally. And the testing sequence contained in the state space is non-redundant and fully covered.</details>

**_Manipulating Visibility of Political and Apolitical Threads on Reddit via Score Boosting_**  
Carman, M.; Koerber, M.; Li, J.; Choo, K. R.; Ashman, H.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>While the phrase 'Fake News' has only recently entered the contemporary vernacular, the problem of other fake content such as reviews or opinion articles is and has been pervasive for many years. False articles and reviews have been used to influence purchasers of goods and services in online commercial and review sites, who have responded by removing such articles and reviews. In response, some promoters employ an alternative promotion method where genuine articles and product reviews are exploited using reader voting mechanisms to promote or suppress the visibility of those articles and reviews. This paper measures the effect of vote manipulation on article visibility and user engagement by comparing sets of threads on Reddit whose visibility is artificially increased. The manipulated threads are compared to sets of control threads. The thread sets were selected from two high-activity subreddits: the apolitical AskReddit and the highly-political The_Donald. The results show that vote manipulation has a significant impact on the visibility of the threads on both subreddits. Clearly, remedial action to detect and deny vote manipulation is needed by sites that allow voting by users.</details>

**_Using Evolutionary Approaches to Manage Surveillance Cameras in Dynamic Environments_**  
Li, R.; Fulp, E.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The efficient management (placement and orientation) of surveillance cameras within a floor plan is a well-known and difficult problem that has regained attention. The objective is to locate the minimum number of cameras in a physical space to ensure important walls are within the view of at least one camera. Heuristic-based approaches have been developed for this NP-hard problem; unfortunately, most do not consider the dynamic conditions that may occur in reality. In these situations, camera availability may change, coverage requirements may be updated, and/or camera movement may be limited. This paper investigates evolutionary-based techniques to manage surveillance cameras under dynamic conditions. Using an evolutionary-based approach, a surveillance configuration (camera locations and orientations) is encoded as a chromosome and evolutionary processes are applied to identify better solutions over successive generations. The approach has the ability to identify efficient surveillance configurations (minimum number of cameras with maximum coverage); however, another advantage is the ability to adapt if the environment changes. Simulation results demonstrate that evolutionary-based approaches can successfully manage surveillance cameras under dynamic conditions.</details>

**_An Elite Clone Parallel Genetic Algorithm for Trust Monitoring Assignment Problem in Adaptive Wireless Sensor Networks_**  
Zhou, J.; Tian, M.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Adaptive wireless sensor networks (AWSNs) consist of sensors that have sensing, computation, wireless communication, and free-infrastructure abilities. AWSNs have applications in the fields of transportation, environmental monitoring, homelands security, automated assistance for the elderly monitors, industrial process control, military purposes and many other areas. The trust monitoring assignment scheme is usually designed for AWSNs to enhance the monitored rate. However, the trust monitoring assignment problem can be formulated as a nonlinear mixed integer optimization problem. In this paper, we propose an elite clone parallel genetic algorithm (ECPGA) based trust monitoring assignment approach for maximizing the monitored rate. We formulate our objective function to optimize the monitored rate under multiple constraints. The proposed algorithm combines the advantages of high efficiency of elite selection and the global search ability of the clone mutation. An analysis is given to show the correctness of ECPGA, and simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance improvement of ECPGA against simulated annealing (SA) and ant colony optimization (ACO). Although sub-optimal for AWSNs systems, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ECPGA algorithm can reach higher monitoring rate compared to the SA and ACO approach.</details>

**_Quality of Information as an indicator of Trust in the Internet of Things_**  
Baqa, H.; Truong, N. B.; Crespi, N.; Lee, G. M.; Gall, F. Le
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The past decade has seen a rise in complexity and scale of software systems, particularly with the emerging of the Internet of Thing consisting of large scale and heterogeneous entities which results in difficulties in providing trustworthy services. To overcome such challenges, providing high quality information for IoT service provider as well as monitoring trust relationship of end-users toward the services are paramount. Such trust relationships are user-oriented and subjective phenomenon that hook on specific quality of data. Following this catalyst, we propose a mechanism to evaluate quality of information (QoI) for streaming data from sensor device; then use the QoI evaluation score as an indicator of trust. Concepts and assessment methodology for QoI along with a trust monitoring system are described. We also develop a framework that classifies streaming of data based on semantic context and generate QoI score as a relevant input for a trust monitoring component. This framework enables a dynamic trust management in the context of IoT for both end-users and services that empowers service providers to deliver trustworthy and high quality IoT services. Challenges encountered during implementation and contribution in standardization are discussed. We believe this paper offers better understanding on QoI and its importance in trust evaluation in IoT applications; also provides detailed implementation of the QoI and Trust components for real-world applications and services.</details>

**_A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Attack Graph Analysis_**  
Yousefi, M.; Mtetwa, N.; Zhang, Y.; Tianfield, H.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Attack graph approach is a common tool for the analysis of network security. However, analysis of attack graphs could be complicated and difficult depending on the attack graph size. This paper presents an approximate analysis approach for attack graphs based on Q-learning. First, we employ multi-host multi-stage vulnerability analysis (MulVAL) to generate an attack graph for a given network topology. Then we refine the attack graph and generate a simplified graph called a transition graph. Next, we use a Q-learning model to find possible attack routes that an attacker could use to compromise the security of the network. Finally, we evaluate the approach by applying it to a typical IT network scenario with specific services, network configurations, and vulnerabilities.</details>

**_Research on Industrial Control Anomaly Detection Based on FCM and SVM_**  
Shang, W.; Cui, J.; Song, C.; Zhao, J.; Zeng, P.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In order to solve the problem of virus and Trojan attacking the application layer network protocol of industrial control system, the rule of Modbus/TCP communication protocol is analyzed. An intrusion detection method based on clustering and support vector machine is proposed. The method combines unsupervised fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM) with supervised support vector (SVM) machine to calculate the distance between industrial control network communication data and cluster center. Partial data satisfying the threshold condition is further classified by support vector machine. Experimental results show that compared with the traditional intrusion detection method, this method can effectively reduce the training time and improve the classification accuracy without needing to know the class label in advance.</details>

**_Authorized Equality Test of Encrypted Data for Secure Cloud Databases_**  
Ma, S.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Equality test is popular in the implementation of database operators, e.g., the keyword search or the natural join. For the privacy concern, public key encryption with equality test (PKEET) as a useful tool to query on the encrypted data has been introduced for the cloud computing in the recent years. In this paper, we propose a variant of PKEET to capture a new feature that only the specified users' ciphertexts could be compared by the cloud server under the users' authorization for the secure cloud database applications. The proposed scheme supports both the user-level authorization and the ciphertext-level authorization for the specified users. Our scheme has a noticeable property that the user is allowed to authorize a third party (e.g., a cloud server) to perform the three types of testing (all-to-all test, one-to-all test and one-to-one test) as well as to make the internal test by the specified users themselves. We prove that our scheme can achieve the IND-CCA security against the outside attack and the PRIV-P-CCA security against the inside attack under the random oracle model, where the latter case is stronger than OW-CCA in most related work.</details>

**_Exploring the Feasibility of Physical Layer Key Generation for LoRaWAN_**  
Xu, W.; Jha, S.; Hu, W.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Physical layer key generation that exploits reciprocity and randomness of wireless fading channels has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Despite much research efforts in this field, the problem of wireless key generation at long distance and low data rate remains unknown and has not been studied. In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments and analysis in real indoor and outdoor environments to explore the feasibility of wireless key generation for Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN). Based on the results, we present LoRa-Key, the first complete key establishment protocol for LoRaWAN by exploring the shared randomness extracted from measured Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). LoRa-Key employs a number of signal processing techniques to improve key generation rate significantly. Experimental results show that LoRa-Key can achieve key establishment rates of 13 bit/s in stationary scenario and 21 bit/s in mobile scenario. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies key generation protocol for LoRaWAN.</details>

**_DDoS Flooding Attack Detection Based on Joint-Entropy with Multiple Traffic Features_**  
Mao, J.; Deng, W.; Shen, F.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are still considered as severe threats to the Internet. Previous works have used information entropy to detect DDoS flooding attacks. However, these methods usually only used source address as the feature of packets, and ignored other features. Besides, the entropy with single variable also has restricts in abnormal detection. In this paper, we propose a new joint-entropy-based DDoS detection solution with multiple features of packets. We choose flow duration, packet length, source address and destination port as the key features to detect different types of DDoS flooding attacks. We carry out the experiments with simulated campus network based on Software-defined Networking (SDN) architecture. The results show that our proposed method can effectively detect attacks of both forged and non-forged source address, and outperforms the previous single-entropy methods in terms of accuracy and false positive rate.</details>

**_Practical Decentralized Attribute-Based Delegation Using Secure Name Systems_**  
Schanzenbach, M.; Banse, C.; Schütte, J.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Identity and trust in the modern Internet are centralized around an oligopoly of identity service providers consisting solely of major tech companies. The problem with centralizing trust has become evident in recent discoveries of mass surveillance and censorship programs as well as information leakage through hacking incidents. One approach to decentralizing trust is distributed, attribute-based access control via attribute-based delegation (ABD). Attribute-based delegation allows a large number of cross-domain attribute issuers to be used in making authorization decisions. Attributes are not only issued to identities, but can also be delegated to other attributes issued by different entities in the system. The resulting trust chains can then be resolved by any entity given an appropriate attribute storage and resolution system. While current proposals often fail at the practicability, we show how attribute-based delegation can be realized on top of the secure GNU Name System (GNS) to solve an authorization problem in a real-world scenario.</details>

**_Abnormal Item Detection Based on Time Window Merging for Recommender Systems_**  
Qi, L. T.; Huang, H. P.; Wang, P.; Wang, R. C.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>CFRS (Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System) is one of the most widely used individualized recommendation systems. However, CFRS is susceptible to shilling attacks based on profile injection. The current research on shilling attack mainly focuses on the recognition of false user profiles, but these methods depend on the specific attack models and the computational cost is huge. From the view of item, some abnormal item detection methods are proposed which are independent of attack models and overcome the defects of user profiles model, but its detection rate, false alarm rate and time overhead need to be further improved. In order to solve these problems, it proposes an abnormal item detection method based on time window merging. This method first uses the small window to partition rating time series, and determine whether the window is suspicious in terms of the number of abnormal ratings within it. Then, the suspicious small windows are merged to form suspicious intervals. We use the rating distribution characteristics RAR (Ratio of Abnormal Rating), ATIAR (Average Time Interval of Abnormal Rating), DAR(Deviation of Abnormal Rating) and DTIAR (Deviation of Time Interval of Abnormal Rating) in the suspicious intervals to determine whether the item is subject to attacks. Experiment results on the MovieLens 100K data set show that the method has a high detection rate and a low false alarm rate.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>With the widely use of cyber threat intelligence, the influence of security threats and cyber attacks have been relieved and controlled in a degree. More and more users have accepted the conception of threat intelligence and are trying to use threat intelligence in routine security protection. Then, how to choose appropriate threat intelligence vendors and services has become a crucial issue. The present research of threat intelligence evaluation mainly focused on one-sided threat intelligence contents and approaches, which was lack of comprehensiveness and effectiveness. Aiming at this situation, we propose the comprehensive evaluation architecture of threat intelligence in user perspective to evaluate threat intelligence services in several dimensions with quantitative index system. We also carried out typical experiments for threat intelligence data feeds and comprehensive situation to verify the feasibility of proposed method.

**_Towards Better Ocular Recognition for Secure Real-World Applications_**  
Parizi, R. M.; Dehghantanha, A.; Choo, K. R.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In the last decade, biometric has become one of the most common uses for verification and authentication of someone's personal identity. Biometrics are defined as the measurement and analysis of unique physical or behavioral characteristics. Fingerprint is undoubtedly the most well-known biometric, but in the recent years ocular recognition has taken a huge jump forward. Ocular recognition (OR) is one of the most reliable personal identification methods in biometrics that can have flexible applications as opposed to the iris recognition. The basic breakdown of the eye is the iris, cornea, retina, pupil, sclera, and conjunctiva. The iris is where eye is actually colored; this is determined by the amount and type of pigment in one's iris. Iris recognition is an accurate form of ocular recognition. It works by using biometric systems to apply pattern recognition to a person's eye since no two people have the same patterns in their eye. Ocular recognition has been used as an identification method on both Apple and Android devices without much popularity. The reason for this is mainly related to the issues with the underlying algorithm used that affects the accuracy and security measures. Many different algorithms have been proposed and tested; some are more accurate than others. Our goal is to investigate different technologies currently used to help combine the best parts of both (Iris and Retina) in order to propose a better system for future implementation. With the proper design, ocular recognition could be a great tool for user authentication in emerging Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile markets.</details>

**_Identifying Peer-to-Peer Botnets Through Periodicity Behavior Analysis_**  
Wang, P.; Wang, F.; Lin, F.; Cao, Z.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Peer-to-Peer botnets have become one of the significant threat against network security due to their distributed properties. The decentralized nature makes their detection challenging. It is important to take measures to detect bots as soon as possible to minimize their harm. In this paper, we propose PeerGrep, a novel system capable of identifying P2P bots. PeerGrep starts from identifying hosts that are likely engaged in P2P communications, and then distinguishes P2P bots from P2P hosts by analyzing their active ratio, packet size and the periodicity of connection to destination IP addresses. The evaluation shows that PeerGrep can identify all P2P bots with quite low FPR even if the malicious P2P application and benign P2P application coexist within the same host or there is only one bot in the monitored network.</details>

**_LUCON: Data Flow Control for Message-Based IoT Systems_**  
Schuette, J.; Brost, G. S.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Today's emerging Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) scenarios are characterized by the exchange of data between services across enterprises. Traditional access and usage control mechanisms are only able to determine if data may be used by a subject, but lack an understanding of how it may be used. The ability to control the way how data is processed is however crucial for enterprises to guarantee (and provide evidence of) compliant processing of critical data, as well as for users who need to control if their private data may be analyzed or linked with additional information - a major concern in IoT applications processing personal information. In this paper, we introduce LUCON, a data-centric security policy framework for distributed systems that considers data flows by controlling how messages may be routed across services and how they are combined and processed. LUCON policies prevent information leaks, bind data usage to obligations, and enforce data flows across services. Policy enforcement is based on a dynamic taint analysis at runtime and an upfront static verification of message routes against policies. We discuss the semantics of these two complementing enforcement models and illustrate how LUCON policies are compiled from a simple policy language into a first-order logic representation. We demonstrate the practical application of LUCON in a real-world IoT middleware and discuss its integration into Apache Camel. Finally, we evaluate the runtime impact of LUCON and discuss performance and scalability aspects.</details>

**_Cache-Collision Attacks on GPU-Based AES Implementation with Electro-Magnetic Leakages_**  
Gao, Y.; Cheng, W.; Zhang, H.; Zhou, Y.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>For computationally-intensive tasks like cryptographic applications, GPU is thought to be an ideal platform due to its parallel computing power. However, some vulnerabilities of GPU have been published due to overflow attacks, covert-channel attacks and side-channel attacks. In this work, for the first time, we investigate cache-collision attacks on GPU-based AES implementation utilizing Electro-Magnetic (EM) leakages. We construct a much efficient leakage model based on generalized simultaneous cache-collision in multi-threads scenarios, and we mount a key-recovery attack with Differential Electro-Magnetic Analysis (DEMA). Our evaluation results show that the 16-byte secret key of GPU-based AES implementation can be recovered with only 5,000 EM traces, and 600 EM traces are enough when assisted with appropriate key enumeration algorithm (KEA). This work suggests that cache-collision on GPU does give rise to leakages via EM side-channels and it should be considered in the design of secure GPU-based cryptographic implementations.</details>

**_An Improved Monte Carlo Graph Search Algorithm for Optimal Attack Path Analysis_**  
Xie, H.; Lv, K.; Hu, C.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The problem of optimal attack path analysis is one of the hotspots in network security. Many methods are available to calculate an optimal attack path, such as Q-learning algorithm, heuristic algorithms, etc. But most of them have shortcomings. Some methods can lead to the problem of path loss, and some methods render the result un-comprehensive. This article proposes an improved Monte Carlo Graph Search algorithm (IMCGS) to calculate optimal attack paths in target network. IMCGS can avoid the problem of path loss and get comprehensive results quickly. IMCGS is divided into two steps: selection and backpropagation, which is used to calculate optimal attack paths. A weight vector containing priority, host connection number, CVSS value is proposed for every host in an attack path. This vector is used to calculate the evaluation value, the total CVSS value and the average CVSS value of a path in the target network. Result for a sample test network is presented to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed algorithm to generate optimal attack paths in one single run. The results obtained by IMCGS show good performance and are compared with Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm (ACO) and k-zero attack graph.</details>

**_Adversarial Gait Detection on Mobile Devices Using Recurrent Neural Networks_**  
Shila, D. M.; Eyisi, E.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>This paper presents an implicit and continuous user verification service, called dCASTRA, for mobile devices based on walking patterns inferred from smart phone sensors. We use LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) neural networks for learning gait biometrics from raw accelerometer and gyroscope data and enable a device centric implementation of the deep learning models for faster predictions. One of the challenges in building a gait biometric model is to differentiate the sensor data pertaining to the walking activity from other activities such as sitting, standing, climbing, running and driving, etc. We design a multi-layer framework, where the initial layer relies on Google Activity Recognition Service to extract the segments corresponding to the walking activity with high confidence and feed extracted time series data to LSTM networks in the subsequent layer. The use of LSTMs eliminate the need for tedious feature engineering and further enable us to capture long-term dependencies within temporal sequences, often overlooked by existing efforts. We use Google TensorFlow to develop LSTM based gait biometrics and deploy on Android-based smart phones for real-time prediction and evaluation. We compare dCASTRA with our prior effort and with other deep network architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Our results manifest that LSTM and CNN based dCASTRA identifies users in an average 5-6 steps (using 50 Hz sensor sampling rate) with 99% detection accuracy. However, CNNs face significant training overhead as opposed to LSTMs which in turn limits its ability to be deployed in practice.</details>

**_AES Design Improvements Towards Information Security Considering Scan Attack_**  
Yu, L.; Zhang, D.; Wu, L.; Xie, S.; Su, D.; Wang, X.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>With the rapid development and globalization of semiconductor industry, data security is becoming a more critical issue for highly confidential devices, especially for cryptography related applications. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is widely used for information security. For AES, the most important data are plaintext and keys, which are the targets of attacks. In this paper, AES security vulnerabilities are analyzed first. Information leakage would be a major concern for AES. Hence one of the most common types of attacks that could leak information at the AES implementation, inserted into AES and utilizing scan chains in or around AES to extract keys or plaintext, is discussed. To deal with the attacks and improve AES circuit's information security, one protection, namely Registered Data Obfuscation, is presented. Experiment results show that with the proposed protection, the scan-based attack is invalidated to leak the critical data. Meanwhile, the proposed protection can also disalbe key Trojan attack introduced in [1, 2]. The cost analysis shows that the additional area and power overhead incurred by the proposed protection are 1.09% and 0.46%, respectively.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>This Breast Cancer in women is the most frequency diagnosed and second leading cause of cancer deaths. Due to complex nature of microcalcification and masses, radiologist fail to properly diagnose breast cancer. In past researchers developed Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems that help the radiologist to detect abnormalities in an efficient manner. In this research, we have employed robust Machine learning classification techniques such as Support vector machine (SVM) kernels and Decision Tree to distinguish cancer mammograms from normal subjects. Different features are proposed such as texture, morphological entropy based, scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), and elliptic Fourier descriptors (EFDs). These features are passed as input to ML classifiers. Jack-knife 10-fold cross validation was used and performance evaluated in term of specificity, sensitivity, Positive predive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), false positive rate (FPR) and receive operating curve (ROC). The highest performance based on single feature extracting strategy was obtained using Bayesian approach with texture and EFDs features, and SVM RBF and Gaussian kernels with EFDs features whereas highest AUC with single feature was obtained using Bayesian approach by extracting texture, morphological, EFDs and entropy features and SVM RBF and Gaussian kernels with EFDs features.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>DDoS has now become the most severe security problem of the Internet. Without in time report, DDoS attack can knock down the victim in no time by exhausting the victim's computing and communicating resources. In this paper we propose STDC-a DDoS defense system. STDC is a two-stage system based on clustering. In the first stage STDC leverage the benefit of SDN and NFV to apply flow-based detection method. STDC use the flow information gathered to do clustering. Since we use cluster analysis as the basic detection algorithm, STDC can separate the DDoS attacks from the legitimate flush crowd easily. In the second stage, we extract attack traffic pattern from the clustering result of the first stage to make blocking rules and use the structure of SDN to quickly dispatch them to achieve effictive and efficient DDoS mitigation. We test STDC using public DDoS dataset and the traffic captured through the gateway. Both of the experiments achieve good detection percision and high filtering ratio.</details>

**_TempatMDS: A Masquerade Detection System Based on Temporal and Spatial Analysis of File Access Records_**  
Wang, J.; Cai, L.; Yu, A.; Zhu, M.; Meng, D.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The need for protecting information stored in the personal computer prompts the development of masquerade detection system (MDS) which raises an alert whenever it detects an anomaly in user behavior. The audit log analysis of local access to files is an effective way to detect masquerader. Due to privacy limitations of file content, most file based detection algorithms mainly focus on the file paths. These methods either formulate the file paths as multiple local features and then input into the classifier, or compare the current file paths with the past ones. However, few works take file actions into account, such as delivering the file to the external drive. By contrast, in this paper we simultaneously consider the file actions and the file paths, and propose a MDS based on the temporal and spatial analysis of file access records (TempatMDS). On the one hand, spatial analysis concentrates on the file path and models path relationships between files accessed in different periods of time, called sub-activity in this paper, as a file access network. Then activity classes are extracted from the network to indicate the user's assignments and the anomaly score of sub-activity is defined as negatively related to the closeness of sub-activity with the activity class. On the other hand, under the assumption that the user usually accesses certain files depend on current assignments in a repetitive way, temporal analysis constructs the file actions sequences from sub-activities, and formulates the anomaly score of sub-activity as negatively related to the sequence occurrence probability. Finally, the ultimate detection result is determined by fusing the anomaly scores from the spatial and temporal analysis in a robust manner. The effectiveness of TempatMDS is clearly demonstrated by its excellent performances on a collected dataset, involving the real file access records from 10 users in our lab and attack data simulated by impersonating the genuine user, in comparison with state-of-the-arts.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Botnet is one of the major threats on the Internet for committing cybercrimes, such as DDoS attacks, stealing sensitive information, spreading spams, etc. It is a challenging issue to detect modern botnets that are continuously improving for evading detection. In this paper, we propose a machine learning based botnet detection system that is shown to be effective in identifying P2P botnets. Our approach extracts convolutional version of effective flow-based features, and trains a classification model by using a feed-forward artificial neural network. The experimental results show that the accuracy of detection using the convolutional features is better than the ones using the traditional features. It can achieve 94.7% of detection accuracy and 2.2% of false positive rate on the known P2P botnet datasets. Furthermore, our system provides an additional confidence testing for enhancing performance of botnet detection. It further classifies the network traffic of insufficient confidence in the neural network. The experiment shows that this stage can increase the detection accuracy up to 98.6% and decrease the false positive rate up to 0.5%.</details>

**_Online Allocation of Cloud Resources Based on Security Satisfaction_**  
Halabi, T.; Bellaiche, M.; Abusitta, A.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Businesses are becoming increasingly interested in exploiting the Cloud Computing technology. However, Cloud insecurity is still among the main factors that are blocking the full migration towards this paradigm. Increasing security investments will speed up the Cloud adoption process and improve the trustworthiness of the Cloud Service Providers (CSP). Moreover, the integration of the security element into the process of resource allocation will help increase the protection of the deployed services. However, this integration requires suitable modeling of customers' security requirements and CSPs' security offerings. To this end, we propose in this paper a broker-based model for the allocation of resources in the Cloud based on service security satisfaction. The resource allocation problem is modeled as a linear optimization problem and solved using an Evolutionary Computation approach, namely, the Genetic Algorithm (GA). The objective is to maximize the global security satisfaction of users' services by placing them on the data centers that adhere the most to their security requirements. Results show that the GA achieves an acceptable approximation of the optimal solution and is computationally efficient, which makes it suitable to function in online mode and cope with the scalability of the Cloud environment.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recently, private information leakage in cloud storage by detecting user's access pattern becomes a hot issue in the security community. Oblivious RAM(ORAM) was proposed to resist this attack. However, the accountability in ORAM is a serious problem because of its oblivious property when consider the malicious user's misbehaves in multi-user cloud storage scenario. Furthermore, based on our observations, the state-of-the-art ORAM design (S-GORAM) has low performance in accountability which also do not support the anonymity. To tackle the above problems, we propose Traceable Oblivious RAM (T-ORAM) which is based on the group signature. Based on our security analysis and simulation experiments, we prove that our scheme outperforms the existing S-GORAM in security and performance of accountability. Moreover, as the byproduct of our design, we also have less storage overhead compared with S-GORAM.</details>

**_For Small Merchants: A Secure Smartphone-Based Architecture to Process and Accept NFC Payments_**  
Madhoun, N. El; Bertin, E.; Pujolle, G.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>EMV is the international protocol implemented to secure the communication between a client's payment device and a PoS during a contact or an NFC purchase transaction. It guarantees several important security properties such as authentication, authorization and integrity. However, researchers, in various studies, have analyzed this protocol and have shown that it is vulnerable to several kinds of attacks. In this paper, we propose an innovative security protocol that solves the EMV vulnerabilities in the context of a new NFC payment architecture. The latter is designed in this work and is especially destined for small merchants, allowing to replace the use of a mobile PoS by an NFC smartphone: we suggest, for a small merchant, to take advantage of his NFC smartphone for use as an NFC reader, and then, directly as a PoS to accept NFC purchases from client payment devices. We check the accuracy of our proposal using the Scyther security tool.</details>

**_Outsourced Private Function Evaluation with Privacy Policy Enforcement_**  
Kunihiro, N.; Lu, W.; Nishide, T.; Sakuma, J.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>We propose a novel framework for outsourced private function evaluation with privacy policy enforcement (OPFE-PPE). Suppose an evaluator evaluates a function with private data contributed by a data contributor, and a client obtains the result of the evaluation. OPFE-PPE enables a data contributor to enforce two different kinds of privacy policies to the process of function evaluation: evaluator policy and client policy. An evaluator policy restricts entities that can conduct function evaluation with the data. A client policy restricts entities that can obtain the result of function evaluation. We demonstrate our construction with three applications: personalized medication, genetic epidemiology, and prediction by machine learning. Experimental results show that the overhead caused by enforcing the two privacy policies is less than 10% compared to function evaluation by homomorphic encryption without any privacy policy enforcement.</details>

**_Universal Optimality of Apollonian Cell Encoders_**  
Biondi, F.; Given-Wilson, T.; Legay, A.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Preserving privacy of private communication against an attacker is a fundamental concern of computer science security. Unconditional encryption considers the case where an attacker has unlimited computational power, hence no complexity result can be relied upon for encryption. Optimality criteria are defined for the best possible encryption over a general collection of entropy measures. This paper introduces Apollonian cell encoders, a class of shared-key cryptosystems that are proven to be universally optimal. In addition to the highest possible security for the message, Apollonian cell encoders prove to have perfect secrecy on their key allowing unlimited key reuse. Conditions for the existence of Apollonian cell encoders are presented, as well as a constructive proof. Further, a compact representation of Apollonian cell encoders is presented, allowing for practical implementation.</details>

**_An Evidential Clustering Based Framework for Cyber Terrorist Cells Topology Identification_**  
Saidi, F.; Trabelsi, Z.; Ghazela, H. Ben
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Nowadays, social networks media are heavily used by cyber terrorist organizations to exchange information, and manage their malicious activities. Effective approaches to understand cyber terrorist organizations structures, working strategies, and operation tactics are required to develop security solutions to prevent their activities. Usually, a terrorist organization includes several sub-groups sharing common proprieties. However, the subgroups may differ in their degree of activities and roles. Hence, understating the topology of a terrorist organization and its operations methods is important to develop efficient prevention solutions. In this paper, we discuss the foundation of an approach for detecting cyber terrorist subgroups, as well as its evaluation and efficiency using data on cyber terrorist groups. The approach is based on an evidential clustering method. In fact, objects (known also as network members) within a cyber terrorist group can be classified into various sub-classes, such as military, finance and local leaders committees. Belief functions are used to describe the membership of nodes to clusters (sub-communities). The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a set of clustering results, regarding the classification of cyber terrorist actors and the allocation of the appropriate degree to each member of a given class. Experimental results show the efficiency and the accuracy of our CECM based approach not only in classifying cyber terrorist actors into the aforementioned communities, but also in allocating a degree of membership for each member to each sub-class.</details>

Achieving flatness or producing honeywords that are equally likely to the original password is one such major concern that requires further attention. Though recent studies have made significant efforts to meet this flatness criterion, our analysis shows that they still fall short to address this issue. In this paper, at first, we have made a detailed investigation to define the basic properties for achieving flatness. Followed by this, we have proposed a questionnaire-based authentication technique which can generate significantly flatter list of honeywords compared to existing state-of-the-art. Further study reveals that the proposed technique passes the other essential evaluation criteria of honeyword based authentication technique with flying colors.</details>

**_A Composite Malicious Peer Eviction Mechanism for Super-P2P Systems_**  
Ismail, H.; Roos, S.; Suri, N.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Large-scale P2P applications (e.g., social networking, online gaming, video streaming) that host millions of users increasingly rely upon semi-structured super-P2P systems to provide efficient services in dynamic environments. Given the critical role of 'super peers' in such topologies, attackers target super peers due to the resultant high damage on P2P services. In this paper, we consider the prominent class of Outgoing Eclipse Attacks (OEA) where an attacker aims to block the communication by controlling all the outgoing connections of honest super peers. Our interest on OEA stems from the fact that our simulation studies reveal that OEAs can cause up to 90% of all service requests to fail. Our attack mitigation relies upon a novel (a) monitoring and (b) malicious peer eviction scheme based on a composite proactive and reactive mechanism. Our proactive mechanism enforces an upper bound on the number of connections an attacker can establish, whereas our reactive mechanism expels malicious peers from the overlay using a distributed consensus protocol. We show that our protection mechanism is highly effective and exhibits a low false-positive rate. Our extensive simulation study validates the analytical results over a large range of parameters with observed detection accuracies of 99% and throughput enhancements of up to 100% while entailing an overhead of less than 5%.</details>

**_S-Audit: Efficient Data Integrity Verification for Cloud Storage_**  
Apolinário, F.; Pardal, M.; Correia, M.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Commercial cloud storage services are being widely adopted. The most common integrity verification methods for data stored remotely are based on cryptographic hashes and digital signatures. These allow checking that the data has not been tampered while stored in the cloud. However, both require downloading all the data before doing the verification, with significant time and monetary costs. This paper presents S-AUDIT, a service that provides integrity verification of data stored in commercial clouds. S-AUDIT uses homomorphic authentication with digital signatures to avoid retrieving the protected data from the cloud. The service was integrated with a cloud-backed file system called SCFS to show how it can be used in practice. Our experimental evaluation shows that using S-AUDIT is 7.1% cheaper than using RSA signatures when the integrity of the data is verified monthly, and 34.9% when verified weekly, in a typical setting.</details>

**_Detecting Intruders and Preventing Hackers from Evasion by Tor Circuit Selection_**  
Cao, Z.; Huang, S. S.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The widely-used Tor network has become the most popular anonymous network that supports circuit-based low-latency internet connections. However, recent security breach incidents reveal SSH have been used to launch attacks by malicious users. Although a server-side blocking mechanism which can identify SSH connections individually has been proposed, we have found that it is restricted to certain Tor circuit protocol versions and not for all SSH protocol implementations. The prior method is based on the difference of latency in the Tor network which may be subject to hacker manipulation by circuit selection in the Tor network. In this paper, we first present a set of attributes that can be used to detect SSH connection through Tor for all SSH handshake between client and server, by observing the network packets exchanges of the SSH protocol. In the second half of this paper, we show that the geographical location of the nodes in Tor circuit has an impact on the effectiveness of our metrics. If hackers know our detection algorithm, they may be able to evade the detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks detection by analyzing multiple Tor circuit selections. Finally, we identify and evaluate our detection algorithm and demonstrate that our algorithm achieves 98% accuracy under the most stringent condition.</details>

**_Good Vibrations: Artificial Ambience-Based Relay Attack Detection_**  
Gurulian, I.; Markantonakis, K.; Frank, E.; Akram, R. N.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Relay attacks are passive man in the middle attacks, aiming to extend the physical distance of devices involved in a transaction beyond their operating environment, within the restricted time-frame. In the field of smartphones, proposals have been put forward suggesting sensing the natural ambient environment as an effective Proximity and Relay Attack Detection (PRAD) mechanism. However, these proposals are not in compliance with industry imposed constraints (e.g. EMV and ITSO) mandating that transactions should complete within a certain time-frame (e.g. 500ms for EMV contactless transactions). The generation of an artificial ambient environment (AAE) using peripherals of the transaction devices has shown positive results when using infrared light as an AAE actuator. In this paper we propose the use of vibration as an alternative AAE actuator. We empirically evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed solution as a PRAD mechanism on an experimental test-bed that we deployed. A total of 36,000 genuine and relay attack transaction pairs were analysed using well-known machine learning algorithms. The results of our analysis indicate that the proposed solution is highly effective.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The design and implementation of Inscription, the first fully automated Adobe Flash binary code transformation system that can guard major Flash vulnerability categories without modifying vulnerable Flash VMs, is presented and evaluated. Inscription affords a means of mitigating the significant class of web attacks that target unpatched, legacy Flash VMs and their apps. Such legacy VMs, and the new and legacy Flash apps that they run, continue to abound in a staggering number of web clients and hosts today; their security issues routinely star in major annual threat reports and exploit kits worldwide. Through two complementary binary transformation approaches based on in-lined reference monitoring, it is shown that many of these exploits can be thwarted by a third-party principal (e.g., web page publisher, ad network, network firewall, or web browser) lacking the ability to universally patch all end-user VMs-write-access to the untrusted Flash apps (prior to execution) suffices. Detailed case-studies describing proof-of-concept exploits and mitigations for five major vulnerability categories are reported.</details>

**_Permission Analysis of Health and Fitness Apps in IoT Programming Frameworks_**  
Nobakht, M.; Sui, Y.; Seneviratne, A.; Hu, W.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Popular IoT programming frameworks, such as Google Fit, enable third-party developers to build apps to store and retrieve user data from a variety of data sources (e.g., wearables). The problem of overprivilege stands out due to the diversity and complexity of IoT apps, and developers rushing to release apps to meet the high demand in the IoT market. Any incorrect API usage of the IoT frameworks by third-party developers can lead to security risks, especially in health and fitness apps. Protecting sensitive user information is critically important to prevent financial and psychological harms. This paper presents PGFIT, a static permission analysis tool that precisely and efficiently identifies overprivilege issues in third-party apps built on top of a popular IoT programming framework, Google Fit. PGFIT extracts the set of requested permission scopes and the set of used data types in Google Fitenabled apps to determine whether the requested permission scopes are actually necessary. In this way, PGFIT serves as a quality assurance tool for developers and a privacy checker for app users. We used PGFIT to perform overprivilege analysis on a set of 20 Google Fit-enabled apps and with manual inspection, we found that 6 (30%) of them are overprivileged.</details>

**_Black Hole Attack Prevention Method Using Multiple RREPs in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks_**  
Noguchi, T.; Hayakawa, M.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a collection of mobile nodes that do not need to rely on a pre-existing network infrastructure or centralized administration. Securing MANETs is a serious concern as current research on MANETs continues to progress. Each node in a MANET acts as a router, forwarding data packets for other nodes and exchanging routing information between nodes. It is this intrinsic nature that introduces the serious security issues to routing protocols. A black hole attack is one of the well-known security threats for MANETs. A black hole is a security attack in which a malicious node absorbs all data packets by sending fake routing information and drops them without forwarding them. In order to defend against a black hole attack, in this paper we propose a new threshold-based black hole attack prevention method using multiple RREPs. To investigate the performance of the proposed method, we compared it with existing methods. Our simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods from the standpoints of packet delivery rate, throughput, and routing overhead.</details>

**_TMDFI: Tagged Memory Assisted for Fine-Grained Data-Flow Integrity Towards Embedded Systems Against Software Exploitation_**  
Liu, T.; Shi, G.; Chen, L.; Zhang, F.; Yang, Y.; Zhang, J.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Memory corruption vulnerabilities are main causes of quite a few modern software attacks. Classical Data-flow integrity, which is originally implemented purely on soft-ware platforms, can perform a good security effect against memory corruption attacks, particularly the newly proposed data-oriented programming attacks. However, it introduces high space and time overheads. To tackle these limitations of DFI, in this paper we present tagged memory supported data-flow integrity, TMDFI, a hardware data-flow integrity implementation to enable fine-grained DFI checks with reduced time and space overheads. Our hardware DFI proposal is based on lowRISC, an existing open-source tagged memory architecture targeting a RISC-V core. The tag fields are enlarged and adopted to keep the identifiers for run-time DFI enforcement. We modified the low-RISC architecture by adding a new instruction that performs multiple tags checking simultaneously and changing some native tag manipulation features. We tested our prototype on an RTL emulator. The result shows that the reduction of run-time overhead of a full inter-procedural DFI enforcement is from 104% to 39% and the space overhead shrinks from 50% to 12.5%.</details>

**_Accessing Data from Multiple Sources Through Context-Aware Access Control_**  
Kayes, A. S. M.; Rahayu, W.; Dillon, T.; Chang, E.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>With the proliferation of cloud-based data and services, accessing data from distributed cloud environments and consequently providing integrated results to the users has become a key challenge, often involving large processing overheads and administrative costs. The traditional, spatial, temporal and other context-sensitive access control models have been applied in different environments in order to access such data and information. Recently, fog-based access control models have also been introduced to overcome the latency and processing issues by moving the execution of application logic from the cloud-level to an intermediary-level through adding computational nodes at the edges of the networks. These existing access control models mostly have been used to access data from centralized sources. However, we have been encountering rapid changes in computing technologies over the last few years, and many organizations need to dynamically control context-sensitive access to cloud data resources from distributed environments. In this article, we propose a new generation of fog-based access control approach, combining the benefits of fog computing and context-sensitive access control solutions. We first formally introduce a general data model and its associated policy and mapping models, in order to access data from distributed cloud sources and to provide integrated results to the users. In particular, we present a unified set of fog-based access control policies with the aim of reducing administrative burdens and processing overheads. We then introduce a unified data ontology together with its reasoning capability by realizing our formal approach. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposal through a prototype testing and several case studies. Experiment results demonstrate the good performance of our approach with respect to our earlier context-sensitive access control approach.</details>

**_Efficient Binary-Encoding Access Control Policy Combination for Large-Scale Collaborative Scenarios_**  
Li, C.; Xie, W.; Zhou, K.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Collaboration among organizations is an important part in an e-business or e-health service. In this case, it is necessary for each organization to share their data with each other in order to provide better services. However, each organization may have specified a set of secure access control policies for shared data, resulting in policy conflicts or differences in a collaboration scenario. Therefore, it is critical to generate an integrated global access control policy for shared common data. Due to low efficiency queries and large memory space, current approaches in security policy integration cannot be applied to large-scale collaboration scenarios. In this paper, we present a binary-encoding policy integration method that can quickly seek the combinable rule sets and easily merge single access control policy into a global policy set. The main idea is that first each policy is converted to a triple, namely <;attribute, action, constraint>, then to encode all attributes and actions in each rule in a binary form, after that to shift and weighted code so as to get combined attribute code, finally to sort code and merge rules. Compared with similar researches, our work can reduce the integration time by 34% and the integration time is stable as the number of attributes increases, hence quite suitable for the large-scale collaborative scenarios.</details>

This paper presents an approach to detect malicious traffic and identify malicious hosts by inspecting flows, leveraging a combination of unsupervised machine learning and threat intelligence, without requiring either previous knowledge about attacks or traffic without attacks. The approach was implemented in the FlowHacker NIDS and evaluated with two kinds of traffic flows: synthetic traffic flows and real ISP traffic flows.</details>

**_Evaluation for Combination of Shuffle and Diversity on Moving Target Defense Strategy for Cloud Computing_**  
Alavizadeh, H.; Jang-Jaccard, J.; Kim, D. S.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Moving Target Defence (MTD) has been recently proposed and is an emerging proactive approach which provides an asynchronous defensive strategies. Unlike traditional security solutions that focused on removing vulnerabilities, MTD makes a system dynamic and unpredictable by continuously changing attack surface to confuse attackers. MTD can be utilized in cloud computing to address the cloud's security-related problems. There are many literature proposing MTD methods in various contexts, but it still lacks approaches to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed MTD method. In this paper, we proposed a combination of Shuffle and Diversity MTD techniques and investigate on the effects of deploying these techniques from two perspectives lying on two groups of security metrics (i) system risk: which is the cloud providers' perspective and (ii) attack cost and return on attack: which are attacker's point of view. Moreover, we utilize a scalable Graphical Security Model (GSM) to enhance the security analysis complexity. Finally, we show that combining MTD techniques can improve both aforementioned two groups of security metrics while individual technique cannot.</details>

**_FRVM: Flexible Random Virtual IP Multiplexing in Software-Defined Networks_**  
Sharma, D. P.; Kim, D. S.; Yoon, S.; Lim, H.; Cho, J.; Moore, T. J.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Network address shuffling is one of moving target defense (MTD) techniques that can invalidate the address information attackers have collected based on the current network IP configuration. We propose a software-defined networking-based MTD technique called Flexible Random Virtual IP Multiplexing, namely FRVM, which aims to defend against network reconnaissance and scanning attacks. FRVM enables a host machine to have multiple, random, time-varying virtual IP addresses, which are multiplexed to a real IP address of the host. Multiplexing or de-multiplexing event dynamically remaps all the virtual network addresses of the hosts. Therefore, at the end of a multiplexing event, FRVM aims to make the attackers lose any knowledge gained through the reconnaissance and to disturb their scanning strategy. In this work, we analyze and evaluate our proposed FRVM in terms of the attack success probability under scanning attacks and target host discovery attacks.</details>

**_Time Independent Security Analysis for Dynamic Networks Using Graphical Security Models_**  
Enoch, S. Yusuf; Hong, J. B.; Kim, D. S.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>It is technically challenging to conduct a security analysis of a dynamic network, due to the lack of methods and techniques to capture different security postures as the network changes. Graphical Security Models (e.g., Attack Graph) are used to assess the security of network systems, but it typically captures a snapshot of a network state to carry out the security analysis. To address this issue, we propose a new Graphical Security Model named Time-independent Hierarchical Attack Representation Model (Ti-HARM) that captures security of multiple network states by taking into account the time duration of each network state and the visibility of network components (e.g., hosts, edges) in each state. By incorporating the changes, we can analyse the security of dynamic networks taking into account all the threats appearing in different network states. Our experimental results show that the Ti-HARM can effectively capture and assess the security of dynamic networks which were not possible using existing graphical security models.</details>

**_Practical Location Validation in Participatory Sensing Through Mobile WiFi Hotspots_**  
Saracino, A.; Restuccia, F.; Martinelli, F.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The reliability of information in participatory sensing (PS) systems largely depends on the accuracy of the location of the participating users. However, existing PS applications are not able to efficiently validate the position of users in large-scale outdoor environments. In this paper, we present an efficient and scalable Location Validation System (LVS) to secure PS systems from location-spoofing attacks. In particular, the user location is verified with the help of mobile WiFi hot spots (MHSs), which are users activating the WiFi hotspot capability of their smartphones and accept connections from nearby users, thereby validating their position inside the sensing area. The system also comprises a novel verification technique called Chains of Sight, which tackles collusion-based attacks effectively. LVS also includes a reputation-based algorithm that rules out sensing reports of location-spoofing users. The feasibility and efficiency of the WiFi-based approach of LVS is demonstrated by a set of indoor and outdoor experiments conducted using off-the-shelf smartphones in Pisa, Italy, while the energy-efficiency of LVS is demonstrated by experiments using the Power Monitor energy tool. Finally, the security properties of LVS are analyzed by simulation experiments. Results indicate that the proposed LVS system is energy-efficient, applicable to most of the practical PS scenarios, and efficiently secures existing PS systems from location-spoofing attacks.</details>

**_MASFOG: An Efficient Mutual Authentication Scheme for Fog Computing Architecture_**  
Imine, Y.; Kouicem, D. E.; Bouabdallah, A.; Ahmed, L.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Fog computing is a new paradigm which extends cloud computing services into the edge of the network. Indeed, it aims to pool edge resources in order to deal with cloud's shortcomings such as latency problems. However, this proposal does not ensure the honesty and the good behavior of edge devices. Thus, security places itself as an important challenge in front of this new proposal. Authentication is the entry point of any security system, which makes it an important security service. Traditional authentication schemes endure latency issues and some of them do not satisfy fog-computing requirements such as mutual authentication between end devices and fog servers. Thus, new authentication protocols need to be implemented. In this paper, we propose a new efficient authentication scheme for fog computing architecture. Our scheme ensures mutual authentication and remedies to fog servers' misbehaviors. Moreover, fog servers need to hold only a couple of information to verify the authenticity of every user in the system. Thus, it provides a low overhead in terms of storage capacity. Finally, we show through experimentation the efficiency of our scheme.</details>

**_A Temporal and Spatial Constrained Attribute-Based Access Control Scheme for Cloud Storage_**  
Liu, Z.; Jiang, Z. L.; Wang, X.; Yiu, S. M.; Zhang, R.; Wu, Y.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Cloud storage service allows data owners to store their (encrypted) data in a remote and may be untrusted cloud server. Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) provides an excellent and flexible solution for data access control. As more and more applications evolved, ABE schemes may not handle all scenarios, in particular, if the access control has a time and location constraint. Time and location attributes are not as static as other general attributes. Existing ABE schemes cannot efficiently handle the continuous range of an attribute making it impractical for temporal and spatial constraints that are changing dynamically. In this paper, we propose a novel temporal and spatial constrained attribute-based access control (TSC-ABAC) scheme to solve this problem. Our system adopts a redesigned access structure and makes use of multi-dimensional range derivation function to match the time domain. This is the first ABE scheme that can efficiently handle time and location elements simultaneously. We further propose an extended TSC-ABAC scheme, which aims at reducing the decryption cost imposed on user. A thorough security and performance analysis shows that our design is secure and efficient. The result of our work could provide a feasible and practical data access control scheme for cloud storage services.</details>

**_DroidPro: An AOTC-Based Bytecode-Hiding Scheme for Packing the Android Applications_**  
Bao, J.; He, Y.; Wen, W.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Android is an open source mobile operating system represented by the Open Handset Alliance (OHA), developed by Google and other organizations since 2007, which has taken up most of the market share of smart devices. However, the applications on the platform are facing the increasingly serious security threat. Although the Android system itself provides a set of security mechanism to protect the safety of the system and applications, there are still many security risks. In order to hide the vulnerability of the applications and prevent the malicious users from tampering the apps, multiple anti-analysis methods have been applied by many Android packers to consolidate the apps. Bytecode-hiding is one of the most effective anti-analysis method, which can extract some bytecode from the Dex files and hide them from the vision of malicious analysts. Mostly, the hidden bytecode was encrypted, which can be recovered in runtime. But the conventional bytecode-hiding methods are always low-efficient and unsafe on some occasions, where the hidden bytecode can be recovered by the malicious analysts in some way. In this paper, we propose a bytecode-hiding scheme based on Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation, called DroidPro, which can compile some chosen bytecode of Dex files of apps to native code in ahead-of-time that will be much harder to reverse. In our experiments, the apps packed by the packer associated with our bytecode-hiding scheme are more efficient and safer than other packers that use other bytecode-hiding schemes.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Critical Infrastructures (CIs) use Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems for remote control and monitoring. Sophisticated security measures are needed to address malicious intrusions, which are steadily increasing in number and variety due to the massive spread of connectivity and standardisation of open SCADA protocols. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) cannot detect attacks that are not already present in their databases. Therefore, in this paper, we assess Machine Learning (ML) for intrusion detection in SCADA systems using a real data set collected from a gas pipeline system and provided by the Mississippi State University (MSU). The contribution of this paper is two-fold: 1) The evaluation of four techniques for missing data estimation and two techniques for data normalization, 2) The performances of Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) are assessed in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1score for intrusion detection. Two cases are differentiated: binary and categorical classifications. Our experiments reveal that RF detect intrusions effectively, with an F1score of respectively > 99%.</details>

**_A Full-Scale Security Visualization Effectiveness Measurement and Presentation Approach_**  
Garae, J.; Ko, R. K. L.; Apperley, M.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>What makes a security visualization effective? How do we measure visualization effectiveness in the context of investigating, analyzing, understanding and reporting cyber security incidents? Identifying and understanding cyber-attacks are critical for decision making - not just at the technical level, but also the management and policy-making levels. Our research studied both questions and extends our Security Visualization Effectiveness Measurement (SvEm) framework by providing a full-scale effectiveness approach for both theoretical and user-centric visualization techniques. Our framework facilitates effectiveness through interactive three-dimensional visualization to enhance both single and multi-user collaboration. We investigated effectiveness metrics including (1) visual clarity, (2) visibility, (3) distortion rates and (4) user response (viewing) times. The SvEm framework key components are: (1) mobile display dimension and resolution factor, (2) security incident entities, (3) user cognition activators and alerts, (4) threat scoring system, (5) working memory load and (6) color usage management. To evaluate our full-scale security visualization effectiveness framework, we developed VisualProgger - a real-time security visualization application (web and mobile) visualizing data provenance changes in SvEm use cases. Finally, the SvEm visualizations aims to gain the users' attention span by ensuring a consistency in the viewer's cognitive load, while increasing the viewer's working memory load. In return, users have high potential to gain security insights in security visualization. Our evaluation shows that viewers perform better with prior knowledge (working memory load) of security events and that circular visualization designs attract and maintain the viewer's attention span. These discoveries revealed research directions for future work relating to measurement of security visualization effectiveness.</details>

**_Data Mining Based Strategy for Detecting Malicious PDF Files_**  
Sayed, S. G.; Shawkey, M.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Portable Document Format (PDF) is one of the widely-accepted document format. However, it becomes one of the most attractive targets for exploitation by malware developers and vulnerability researchers. Malicious PDF files can be used in Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) targeting individuals, governments, and financial sectors. The existing tools such as intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and antivirus packages are inefficient to mitigate this kind of attacks. This is because these techniques need regular updates with the new malicious PDF files which are increasing every day. In this paper, a new algorithm is presented for detecting malicious PDF files based on data mining techniques. The proposed algorithm consists of feature selection stage and classification stage. The feature selection stage is used to the select the optimum number of features extracted from the PDF file to achieve high detection rate and low false positive rate with small computational overhead. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve 99.77% detection rate, 99.84% accuracy, and 0.05% false positive rate.</details>

Our proposed solution focus on security, privacy, and usability using FIDO UAF, TEE, and SAML standards. A prototype was developed and evaluated through functional test cases and an user usability satisfaction questionnaire. The results showed our proposed mobile eID system contributes more to user privacy than the currently e-Gov services. However, we observed in the experiments that usability could be affected when the user does not understand alert messages.</details>

**_Blockchain Based Secured Identity Authentication and Expeditious Revocation Framework for Vehicular Networks_**  
Malik, N.; Nanda, P.; Arora, A.; He, X.; Puthal, D.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Authentication and revocation of users in Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETS) are two vital security aspects. It is extremely important to perform these actions promptly and efficiently. The past works addressing these issues lack in mitigating the reliance on the centralized trusted authority and therefore do not provide distributed and decentralized security. This paper proposes a blockchain based authentication and revocation framework for vehicular networks, which not only reduces the computation and communication overhead by mitigating dependency on a trusted authority for identity verification, but also speedily updates the status of revocated vehicles in the shared blockchain ledger. In the proposed framework, vehicles obtain their Pseudo IDs from the Certificate Authority (CA), which are stored along with their certificate in the immutable authentication blockchain and the pointer corresponding to the entry in blockchain, enables the Road Side Units (RSUs) to verify the identity of a vehicle on road. The efficiency and performance of the framework has been validated using the Omnet++ simulation environment.</details>

One such DoS attack is the data-to-control plane saturation attack, where an attacker floods a large number of packets to trigger massive table-misses and packet-in messages in the data plane. This attack can exhaust resources of different components of the SDN infrastructure, including TCAM and buffer memory in the data plane, bandwidth of the control channel, and CPU cycles of the controller. In this paper, we analyze the vulnerability of SDN against the data-to-control plane saturation attack extensively and design FloodShield, a comprehensive, deployable and lightweight SDN defense framework to mitigate this dedicated DoS attack. FloodShield combines the following two techniques: 1) source address validation which filters forged packets directly in the data plane, and 2) stateful packet supervision which monitors traffic states of real addresses and performs dynamic countermeasures based on evaluation scores and network resource usages. Implementations and experiments demonstrate that, compared with previous defense frameworks, FloodShield provides effective protection for all three components of the SDN infrastructure - data plane, control channel and control plane - with less resource consumption.</details>

**_A Lightweight FourQ Primitive on ARM Cortex-M0_**  
Zhang, W.; Lin, D.; Zhang, H.; Zhou, X.; Gao, Y.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>We describe the implementation of FourQ, an efficient Elliptic Curve Cryptographic (ECC) primitive with 128-bit security level, on 32-bit ARM Cortex-M0 microprocessor. It is the first time to implement FourQ curve on ARM Cortex-M0, the smallest processor available among whole series ARM productions and is suitable for embedded applications, such as wireless sensor networks (WSN) and Internet of Things (IoT). In finite field arithmetic, we propose a new strategy to improve the performance of Karatsuba multi-precision multiplicaion, which is the most significant operation for FourQ. In order to achieve high performance, we also utilize assembly code to achieve all the operations of field arithmetic. In curve arithmetic, we simplify the projective coordinates of original implementation of FourQ, and optimize the memory usage of point addition and point doubling, which makes it more applicable to embedded processor and corresponding applications. By combining the excellent properties of FourQ curve and optimized modification on ARM Cortex-M0, we show that the performance of scalar multiplication of FourQ is faster than exiting works on the same target microprocessor with the same security level. Experiments show that our scalar multiplication runs in under 1972k clock cycles on the Cortex-M0, improving on the speed record ukummer curve by 25.2% and Curve25519 by 45%.</details>

**_Pangr: A Behavior-Based Automatic Vulnerability Detection and Exploitation Framework_**  
Liu, D.; Wang, J.; Rong, Z.; Mi, X.; Gai, F.; Tang, Y.; Wang, B.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Nowadays, with the size and complexity of software increasing rapidly, vulnerabilities are becoming diversified and hard to identify. It is unpractical to detect and exploit vulnerabilities by manual construction. Therefore, an efficient automatic method of detecting and exploiting software vulnerability is in critical demand. This paper implements Pangr, an entire system for automatic vulnerability detection, exploitation, and patching. Pangr builds a complete vulnerability model based on its triggering behavior to identify vulnerabilities and generate exp or exploit schemes. According to the type and feature of the vulnerability, Pangr can generate the specific patch for the software. In the experiment, we tested 20 vulnerable programs on 32-bit Linux machine. Pangr detected 16 vulnerabilities, generated 10 exp, and patched 14 programs.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>This paper investigates the intrinsic relationship between secure network coding and secure cloud storage. We propose a novel homomorphic signature scheme and then illustrate a method to construct the network coding based secure cloud storage (NCSCS) protocol, wherein the security of the homomorphic signature scheme is the foundation of the NCSCS protocol. By employing network coding and homomorphic signature technique, the proposed NCSCS system can serve as both cloud service provider and router of a communication network at the same time, where the public auditing of the outsourced data is enabled. Finally, we perform the simulation of the proposed protocol and evaluate its performance. The security and efficiency can be validated from the simulation results.</details>

**_Securing Wireless Networks from Sinkhole and Sybil Attacks Using Secure Data Aggregation Protocol_**  
Rizvi, S.; Gualdoni, J.; Razaque, A.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The existing secure data aggregation approaches for wireless sensor networks were not designed for authorization, energy efficiency and proper security, leaving them prone to attacks. In this paper, we introduce a secure data aggregation using access control and authentication (SDAACA) protocol. Using this protocol, we aim to detect two types of attacks: Sinkhole and Sybil attacks that are difficult to detect by existing cryptographic approaches. The proposed SDAACA protocol consists of two novel algorithms: the secure data fragmentation process and the node authorization process. The first algorithm hides the data from the adversary by fragmenting it into small pieces. In the second algorithm, an authorization process is initiated before allowing any new node to join the network. Moreover, we propose an access control paradigm that supports accuracy, energy efficiency, freshness and authentication by reducing the communication overhead and guaranteeing the communication authenticity process. Furthermore, the proposed protocol is mapped on the oil-refinery plant to prevent and detect both Sinkhole and Sybil attacks in presence of static and mobile sensor nodes. Finally, we show the effectiveness of our proposed protocol through extensive simulations and compared the results against other known similar types of secure data aggregation protocols.</details>

**_A Novel Multi-source Fusion Model for Known and Unknown Attack Scenarios_**  
Wang, Q.; Jiang, J.; Shi, Z.; Wang, W.; Lv, B.; Qi, B.; Yin, Q.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Nowadays, it is difficult to attract researchers with single data to do network security research. The single data is not comprehensive and can't depict the change of malicious attacks fully, it's reliability and authenticity are also difficult to determine, so the research of multi-source data fusion can help to distinguish the authenticity of data and obtain better results. In this paper, we propose a multi-source fusion model that uses ontologies to represent and store different information resources, employs logic reference rules to remove redundant and reduce false-positives, reconstructs scenario of the known attack and uses a new AOI-FIM algorithm for mining attack patterns of the unknown attack scenarios. The key benefit of the model is that it solves the syntax and semantic expression in the multi-source heterogeneous data and mines some unknown attack patterns. To illustrate and evaluate our approach, we use two separate case studies from the Darpa2000 and the Vast Challenge2012 dataset. The results show that our approach can reduces false positives obviously, builds scenario effectively for known attacks and mines frequent attack patterns exactly for unknown attacks.</details>

**_Adaptive Malicious URL Detection: Learning in the Presence of Concept Drifts_**  
Tan, G.; Zhang, P.; Liu, Q.; Liu, X.; Zhu, C.; Dou, F.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Hackers can implant malwares (e.g. Trojans, Worms, etc.) in the web pages to steal user information and acquire money illegally. In fact, it is noted that close to one-third of all websites are potentially malicious in nature. Therefore, It makes sense to quickly detect malicious URLs on the Internet. Different from most of previous methods, in this paper, we propose a method for online malicious URL detection based on adaptive learning. By collecting the network traffic from backbone networks, we train machine learning models to detect malicious URLs. But there is a serious problem in dynamically changing environments where the statistical properties of target variable change over time, which is known as concept drift. To address this problem, we apply a nonparametric test to correctly detect concept drifts in adaptive learning. Extensive experiments with different types of concept drifts are performed to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed method on both artificial and real datasets. Our empirical study shows that this approach has good performance in detecting malicious URLs and concept drifts.</details>

**_Hierarchical Clustering Based Network Traffic Data Reduction for Improving Suspicious Flow Detection_**  
Su, L.; Yao, Y.; Li, N.; Liu, J.; Lu, Z.; Liu, B.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Attacks like APT have lasted for a long time which need suspicious flow detection on long-time data. However, the challenge of effectively analyzing massive data source for suspicious flow diagnosis is unmet yet. Consequently, flow data reduction should be adopted, which refers to abstract the most relevant information from the massive dataset. Existing approaches to sampling flow data are inherently inaccurate unless running at high sampling rate. In this paper, we proposed HCBS (Hierarchical Clustering Based Sampling), a flow data reduction scheme, to alleviate such problems. We study the characteristics of flow data relating malicious activities and employ hierarchical clustering to sample data for further deep detection. Experiments on 1999 DARPA dataset demonstrates that HCBS reduces the size of the flow data by 40% with only a small loss in accuracy and significantly outperforms the compared state-of-the-art.</details>

**_BotCensor: Detecting DGA-Based Botnet Using Two-Stage Anomaly Detection_**  
Qi, B.; Jiang, J.; Shi, Z.; Mao, R.; Wang, Q.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Nowadays, most botnets utilize domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to build resilient and agile command and control (C&C) channels. Specifically, botmasters employ DGAs to dynamically produce a large number of random domains and only register a small subset for their actual C&C servers with the purpose to defend them from takeovers and blacklisting attempts. While many approaches and models have been developed to detect DGA-based botnets, they suffer from several limitations, such as difficulties of DNS traffic collection, low feasibility and scalability, and so forth. In this paper, we present BotCensor, a new system that can determine if a host is infected with certain DGA malware with two-stage anomaly detection. In the first stage, we preliminarily attempt to identify malicious domains using a Markov model, and in the second stage, we re-examine the hosts that requested aforementioned malicious domains using novelty detection algorithms. Our experimental results show that our approach performs very well on identifying previously unknown DGA-generated domains and detects DGA bots with high efficiency and efficacy. Our approach not only can be regarded as security forensics tools, but also can be used to prevent malware infections and spread.</details>

**_A General and Expandable Insider Threat Detection System Using Baseline Anomaly Detection and Scenario-Driven Alarm Filters_**  
Yang, G.; Cai, L.; Yu, A.; Meng, D.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The insider threat continues to be a paramount cyber security challenge that threatens individuals, financial enterprises and governmental organizations. To deter insider threats, the scenario-driven detection approach has been a hot topic. However, the technological limitations in practice severely constrain the scenario-driven detection effect in reality. Therefore we propose a new general and expandable insider threat detection system that divides the detection into two functional modules: the baseline anomaly detection module, which are competent with multiple attack-scenario detections based on multi-domain behavioral mode features with adaptive characteristics, and the scenario-driven alarm filter module based on time-based anomaly frequency degree(TAFD) and attack beginning analysis. The multi-domain behavioral mode features enable us to effectively identify the user's abnormal behavior in general feature extraction and classification organization without a specific scenario analysis, whereas the exemplary scenario-driven alarm filter based on the time-based anomaly frequency degree is used to distinguish benign anomaly and attack anomaly according to the frequency characteristics from the scenario analysis, besides a specific alarm filter based on attack beginning analysis. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed general and expandable insider threat detection system, by showing satisfactory true positive rate(TPR) and low false positive rate(FPR) with reasonable hit and tradeoff rate for multiple attack scenarios. This work lays the foundation for a promising insider threat detection architecture that integrates multiple scenario-driven detections into a normative, flexible and effective modular system.</details>

**_Provably Secure Password Reset Protocol: Model, Definition, and Construction_**  
Ohata, S.; Matsuda, T.; Matsuura, K.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Many online services adopt a password-based user authentication system because of its usability. However, several problems have been pointed out on it, and one of the well-known problems is that a user forgets his/her password and cannot login the services. To solve this problem, most online services support a backup authentication mechanism with which a user can reset a password. However, negative facts about security have been reported for a popular backup authentication mechanism. In this paper, we consider a provable security treatment for a password reset protocol. First, we formalize a model and security definitions. We consider security against active adversaries that can mount man-in-the-middle attacks and concurrent attacks. Then we propose a generic construction of a password reset protocol secure under our definitions based on pseudorandom functions and public key encryption. In addition, we implement a prototype of our protocol to evaluate its efficiency.</details>

**_VegaStar: An Illegal Domain Detection System on Large-Scale Video Traffic_**  
Tian, X.; Zhu, Y.; Li, Z.; Zheng, C.; Sun, Y.; Liu, Q.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Today online video is growing and becoming increasingly popular on the Web. It is no secret that illegal content is now a one-click-away from everyone, including children and minors. Intelligent video analysis methods can help to automatically detect and isolate questionable content in media. Unfortunately, these methods are hugely costly, and affecting public privacy. In this paper, we present an illegal domain detection system on large-scale video traffic, VegaStar. Using metadata of over 5 million URLs of video, VegaStar: (i) provides lexical and behavior characteristics of video domain names, (ii) proposes a model to detect illegal video domains constructed by twelve feature sets, (iii) detects website domains hosting illegal video content even before the videos are being downloaded, and (iv) understand different CDNs and cloud providers that host content for a particular resource. We conduct extensive experimental analysis and the result shows that the proposed model can classify domains with accuracy approximately 90% by cross validation experiments on Random Forest. We argue that VegaStar represents an important development in the field of video traffic identification, and it can be significantly improve the efficiency of former methods.</details>

**_An Experimental Flow Secure File System_**  
Rudrapatna, S.; Kumar, N. Narendra; Taware, A.; Vyas, P.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Information-flow control (IFC) encompasses several practical end-to-end security requirements including confidentiality and integrity, and is widely regarded as a uniform approach to building secure systems. File system is an important component of any secure system as it is the most widely used channel for information sharing among applications. In this paper, we present a design and implementation of a secure file system, based on the Readers-Writers Flow Model (RWFM), for a Linux OS. The secure file system imposes requisite access controls at the granularity of operating system processes, and controls information-flow via the file-system objects. That the system indeed prevents misuse of indirect information flow is demonstrated by encoding practical security policies like the standard Linux access controls, RBAC, Chinese-wall etc. One of the distinct characteristics of the approach is that it satisfies the property of labeled security protection as envisaged in the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria; perhaps the first on a full file system of a widely used OS. Another distinct advantage of our system is that it requires (i) minimal effort from the end-user for specifying the initial policy, and (ii) no additional effort from the programmers perspective. The current implementation is illustrated through examples, compared with implementations of other similar efforts related to file-systems and other relevant facets from the literature.</details>

**_VMPBL: Identifying Vulnerable Functions Based on Machine Learning Combining Patched Information and Binary Comparison Technique by LCS_**  
Liu, D.; Li, Y.; Tang, Y.; Wang, B.; Xie, W.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Nowadays, most vendors apply the same open source code to their products, which is dangerous. In addition, when manufacturers release patches, they generally hide the exact location of the vulnerabilities. So, identifying vulnerabilities in binaries is crucial. However, just searching source program has a lower identifying accuracy of vulnerability, which requires operators further to differentiate searched results. Under this context, we propose VMPBL to enhance identifying the accuracy of vulnerability with the help of patch files. VMPBL, compared with other proposed schemes, uses patched functions according to its vulnerable functions in patch file to further distinguish results. We establish a prototype of VMPBL, which can effectively identify vulnerable function types and get rid of safe functions from results. Firstly, we get the potential vulnerable-patched functions by binary comparison technique based on K-Trace algorithm. Then we combine the functions with vulnerability and patch knowledge database to classify these function pairs and identify the possible vulnerable functions and the vulnerability types. Finally, we test some programs containing real-world CWE vulnerabilities, and one of the experimental results about CWE415 shows that the results returned from only searching source program are about twice as much as the results from VMPBL. We can see that using VMPBL can significantly reduce the false positive rate of discovering vulnerabilities compared with analyzing source files alone.</details>

**_NTPDroid: A Hybrid Android Malware Detector Using Network Traffic and System Permissions_**  
Arora, A.; Peddoju, S. K.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Two kinds of techniques, namely Static and Dynamic Analysis, have been proposed in the literature to detect Android malware. Permissions and Network Traffic are the widely used detection attributes. Malicious apps download malware at run-time and evade static permissions based detection while they can be detected by the network traffic. The malware that do not require network connectivity evade network traffic based detection which can be detected by permissions analysis. Therefore, we believe that combining the network traffic and system permissions will enhance the detection rate. Hence, in this work, we combine both the attributes and propose a hybrid detection model named NTPDroid, that extracts Network Traffic features and Permissions from the applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt towards combining these important sources of Android malware detection. We train and test the proposed model using the FP-Growth algorithm to generate the frequent patterns consisting of traffic features and permissions. Experimental results demonstrate a detection accuracy of 94.25%, better than frequent patterns obtained independently.</details>

**_Energy Exhaustion Attack on Barrett's Reduction_**  
Mostafa, M.; Banerjee, T.; Hasan, M. A.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Modular reduction is an integral part of the underlying computation in several cryptographic systems. This paper identifies a potential vulnerability in one of the most well-known reduction algorithms, namely Barrett's reduction algorithm. The vulnerability lies in the algorithm's while loop which is usually unbounded in straightforward implementation. An adversary can exploit the vulnerability by tampering with the sign flag of the processor's status register. Our work reveals that attacks exploiting such weaknesses can cause a huge amount of completely unnecessary arithmetic operations, rapidly draining energy from a cryptographic device that implements this reduction. Devices running on batteries, for example laptops and smart phones, will lose energy completely when faced with such attacks. This kind of consequences might also result if the sign flag becomes faulty due to natural causes such as voltage glitches or exposure to radiations. Countermeasures for the aforementioned vulnerability are also discussed in this paper.</details>

**_Authentication of IoT Device and IoT Server Using Secure Vaults_**  
Shah, T.; Venkatesan, S.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Internet of Things is a topic of much interest and, in last few years, security of the IoT systems is a field of tremendous research activities. Mutual authentication between IoT devices and IoT servers is an important part of secure IoT systems. Single password-based authentication mechanisms, which are widely used, are vulnerable to side-channel and dictionary attacks. In this paper, we present a multi-key (or multi-password) based mutual authentication mechanism. In our approach, the shared secret between the IoT server and the IoT device is called secure vault, which is a collection of equal sized keys. Initial contents of the secure vault are shared between the server and the IoT device and contents of the secure vault change after every successful communication session. We have implemented this mechanism on an Arduino device to prove our algorithm is feasible on IoT devices with memory and computational power constraints.</details>

**_Using Feature Selection to Identify Chains of Insecure Software Configuration Parameters_**  
Fulp, E.; Gage, H. D.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Configurations provide the ability to adjust the behavior of software for a specific deployment; however, ensuring the configuration yields a functional and secure system can be problematic. Configurations can consist of a large number of parameters to manage and contain unknown parameter interdependencies referred to as a parameter chain. The parameters that compose the parameter chain must be set with respect to each other and this additional complexity makes the identification and resolution difficult for system administrators. This paper introduces an evolutionary-based feature selection technique designed to identify and resolve parameter chains found in software configurations. Given a diverse set of configurations (for the same application), random forests are used to determine the importance of the configuration parameters. These importance values are then clustered to identify the parameters belonging to the parameter chain. Identifying a diverse set of configurations is critical. As a result, an evolutionary algorithm is used to discover configurations that have these characteristics. These processes then repeat until the system has converged on a set of suspected chain parameters. The effectiveness of this approach is analyzed experimentally through a study of Apache configurations that are misconfigured with various types of parameter chains. Experimental results indicate the approach is able to identify and resolve parameter chains that have varying complexity (chain composition and logical structure) and length (number of parameters).</details>

**_Reinforcing IoT-Enforced Security Policies_**  
Oualha, N.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>To provide confidentiality protection and access control to large amount of data generated by the Internet of Things (IoT), one promising approach lies on the use of Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE). However, the ABE-based approach needs to cope with the resource constraints of IoT devices, by providing data encryption and access control only under small access policies. With the goal to mitigate this limitation inherent to the IoT, this paper introduces a new technique that relies on semi-trusted intermediate entities to reinforce large access policies derived from small policies enforced by IoT devices without revealing the encrypted data.</details>

**_Enhancing Security and Scalability in Software Defined LTE Core Networks_**  
Gu, R.; Zhang, X.; Yu, L.; Zhang, J.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The rapid development of mobile networks has revolutionized the way of accessing the Internet. The exponential growth of mobile subscribers, devices and various applications frequently brings about excessive traffic in mobile networks. The demand for higher data rates, lower latency and seamless handover further drive the demand for the improved mobile network design. However, traditional methods can no longer offer cost-efficient solutions for better user quality of experience with fast time-to-market. Recent work adopts SDN in LTE core networks to meet the requirement. In these software defined LTE core networks, scalability and security become important design issues that must be considered seriously. In this paper, we propose a scalable channel security scheme for the software defined LTE core network. It applies the VxLAN for scalable tunnel establishment and MACsec for security enhancement. According to our evaluation, the proposed scheme not only enhances the security of the channel communication between different network components, but also improves the flexibility and scalability of the core network with little performance penalty. Moreover, it can also shed light on the design of the next generation cellular network.</details>

**_Uninterrupted Video Surveillance in the Face of an Attack_**  
Vempati, J.; Dantu, R.; Thompson, M.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks continue to plague businesses and consumers alike, and due to an ever-growing digital landscape, these attacks are expected to grow in size and complexity. Current mitigation techniques ranging from hours to days are completely unacceptable given the cost and inconvenience these attacks place in our society. This paper puts forth three feedback control mechanisms to minimize the effects of DDoS attacks on real-time traffic. The first, called differentiated services code point (DSCP) Markdown, is a passive approach that uses micro firewall rules to lower the priority of out-of-profile packets while a second mechanism actively drops the out-of-profile packets based on rate and burst size parameters. The third technique uses parallel links when feedback is applied to stabilize the network after an attack has been detected. Results from all three techniques have shown to have a positive effect on real-time traffic. The first two approaches were able to stabilize network traffic in real-time, while the parallel links technique resulted in a slight delay. We validate the feedback mechanisms with our model that was generated using the system identification technique. Results show that the feedback architecture provides a fit accuracy with positive results.</details>

**_Enhancing the Naive Bayes Spam Filter Through Intelligent Text Modification Detection_**  
Peng, W.; Huang, L.; Jia, J.; Ingram, E.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Spam emails have been a chronic issue in computer security. They are very costly economically and extremely dangerous for computers and networks. Despite of the emergence of social networks and other Internet based information exchange venues, dependence on email communication has increased over the years and this dependence has resulted in an urgent need to improve spam filters. Although many spam filters have been created to help prevent these spam emails from entering a user's inbox, there is a lack or research focusing on text modifications. Currently, Naive Bayes is one of the most popular methods of spam classification because of its simplicity and efficiency. Naive Bayes is also very accurate; however, it is unable to correctly classify emails when they contain leetspeak or diacritics. Thus, in this proposes, we implemented a novel algorithm for enhancing the accuracy of the Naive Bayes Spam Filter so that it can detect text modifications and correctly classify the email as spam or ham. Our Python algorithm combines semantic based, keyword based, and machine learning algorithms to increase the accuracy of Naive Bayes compared to Spamassassin by over two hundred percent. Additionally, we have discovered a relationship between the length of the email and the spam score, indicating that Bayesian Poisoning, a controversial topic, is actually a real phenomenon and utilized by spammers.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Apache Spark is an efficient distributed computing framework for big data processing. It supports in-memory computation of RDDs (Resilient Distributed Dataset) and provides a provision of reusability, fault tolerance, and real-time stream processing. However, the tasks in Spark framework are only performed on CPU. The low degree of parallelism and power inefficiency of CPU may restrict the performance and scalability of the cluster. In order to improve the performance and power dissipation of the data center, heterogeneous accelerators such as FPGA, GPU, MIC (Many Integrated Core) exhibit more efficient performance than the general-purpose processor in big data processing. In this work, we propose a framework to integrate FPGA accelerator into a Spark cluster. We use FPGA to accelerate the Spark tasks developed with Python, and in this way, the main computing load is performed on FPGA instead of CPU. We illustrate the performance of the FPGA based Spark framework with a case study of 2D-FFT algorithm acceleration. The results showed that FPGA based Spark implementation acquires 1.79x speedup than CPU implementation.</details>

**_A Multiple Layer Sercurity Architecture for Internet of Things into MVC Design_**  
Chen, H.; Dai, H.; Qiu, M.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Secure Layered architecture(SLA) has been become a widely used Architecture model. Each layer represents a kind of function. In the current process of software development, the most SLA is based on MVC: Model, View and Controller. Model is the layer that is used to communicate with database and provides the data for controller. Controller is the logical layer, it is responsible for handling the data provided from model and serve the layer of view. And the View is used to display the data. The Three tier architecture(TTA) is practical in most development. But In some project, whose business is more complex and the number of requests is bigger, the TTA has a little bad performance. For better development and better performance, The more secure multiple layer architecture(MMLA) is put forward. Besides the MVC, The MMLA splits the layer of model and controller. Based on the business logic and the service request, they are split into multiple layers for different business and different layer is put into the different server. This kind of layers can not only reducing coupling with modules and also improve the extensibility of the system. The way that the Different layer is in the different server can greatly improved the data security. Experiments show that The performance, the expansibility and the security can be greatly improved but also obtaining the satisfactory service with our proposed MMLA.</details>

We evaluate the approach with other existing ECC schemes including ECC standard, EC-Schnorr and ECC-Montgomery.</details>

**_Signature Renewal for Low Entropy Data_**  
Atighehchi, K.; Barbier, M.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>We consider the problem of publicly authenticating low entropy data, or even data which vary slightly over time, with an assurance on their freshness at the time of authentication. While traditional digital signatures can be used, it is always interesting to decrease the computation costs of a signature generation. This is particularly true when authentication of a value is requested on a frequent or regular basis. In this paper, we investigate how we can amortize the cost of an asymmetric signature scheme by the use of cryptographic hash-based data structures. For this purpose, we revisit data structures that were previously used for certificate revocation and micro-payment, namely Merkle trees and QuasiModo trees. We thus propose two lightweight signature schemes amortizing the use of a traditional signature scheme. The first one refreshes at low cost the validity period of a signature, assuming we are able to estimate the number of consecutive validity periods over which the data will not change. The second scheme does not require any prediction and refreshes both the validity and the value to authenticate. Finally, optimization trade-offs and the use of a weak hash function are discussed.</details>

Although we have no pretensions of completeness, our results indicate that this is a promising approach to differentiate between normal and abnormal network traffic behavior, and therefore a promising contribution to anomaly based intrusion detection.</details>

**_Efficient Cross-User Deduplication of Encrypted Data Through Re-Encryption_**  
Tang, X.; Zhou, L.; Huang, Y.; Chang, C.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Cross-user deduplication is an emerging technique to ease the burden of cloud storage in big data era by storing only one copy of duplicate data. Efficiency reflects the feasibility and is a basic consideration when applying the deduplication scheme. However, in order to achieve certain level of security, existing works suffer from heavy overhead of computation as well as communication, which is a big obstacle for the actual deployment. In this paper, we propose an efficient cross-user deduplication scheme for encrypted data, which takes the lead to consider the efficiency during deduplication and makes it a reality to achieve secure deduplication in a lightweight way. To ensure the efficiency, we utilize the proposed re-encryption technique together with a non-interactive convergent key generation scheme to eliminate the cost of users and support batch verification of recovered data. The simulation results show that, with the same level of security guaranteed, the proposed scheme is more efficient comparing with the state of the art.</details>

**_Detecting Data Leakage from Databases on Android Apps with Concept Drift_**  
Kul, G.; Upadhyaya, S.; Chandola, V.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Mobile databases are the statutory backbones of many applications on smartphones, and they store a lot of sensitive information. However, vulnerabilities in the operating system or the app logic can lead to sensitive data leakage by giving the adversaries unauthorized access to the app's database. In this paper, we study such vulnerabilities to define a threat model, and we propose an OS-version independent protection mechanism that app developers can utilize to detect such attacks. To do so, we model the user behavior with the database query workload created by the original apps. Here, we model the drift in behavior by comparing probability distributions of the query workload features over time. We then use this model to determine if the app behavior drift is anomalous. We evaluate our framework on real-world workloads of three different popular Android apps, and we show that our system was able to detect more than 90% of such attacks.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this paper, we propose Acies, a differential privacy based privacy-preserving classification system for edge computing to secure the classification models offloaded to edge devices. Acies supports popular classifiers such as Nearest Neighborhood, Support Vector Machine and Sparse Representation Classifier with a variety of feature selection methods. According to our evaluation on different datasets, classification models with Acies can be private and remain high utility. Acies achieves reliable privacy protection under reconstruction attacks with minimal impact on classification accuracy (2%-5%) only. Acies outperforms the naive input dataset perturbation methods by up to 30% higher classification accuracy when the privacy requirements of the applications is high (ϵ is less than 2).</details>

**_PAIRS: Privacy-Aware Identification and Recommendation of Spatio-Friends_**  
Wang, S.; Sinnott, R.; Nepal, S.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Due to the prevalence of location-based services, it has now become possible to infer social connections between people by observing their spatial behaviors over time. Such spatial behaviors, if shared, can be utilized to identify and recommend friends for web-based social service users. However, such approaches cannot be implemented without solving two key challenges: (a) guaranteeing an individual's privacy in the shared spatiotemporal data, and (b) addressing the inherent sparseness of shared spatiotemporal data. In this paper, we propose a Privacy-Aware Identification and Recommendation of Spatio-Friends (PAIRS) approach, that can infer and recommend potential social connections by analyzing spatiotemporal information of social media users using robust privacy guarantee mechanisms. To achieve this, PAIRS constructs co-occurrence profiles using a cluster-based anchor representation to alleviate the sparseness of shared spatiotemporal information. It utilizes the diversity, time and weighted frequency-based inference to efficiently infer the strength of potential social connections from co-occurrence profile by reducing the negative impact of coincidences and thereby enhances accuracy. To tackle the privacy concerns, PAIRS sanitizes the cluster-based anchors, the location entropy values as well as the co-occurrence profile under differential privacy, including optimization mechanisms to handle trade-offs in utility and privacy. Extensive experiments are conducted with real-world datasets including both individuals' spatiotemporal data and their actual social connections. We confirm that our approach can achieve two often contradictory goals: a provable robust privacy protection for sharing data and an efficient social strength inference and spatio-friend identification mechanism. Specifically, PAIRS remains approximately 70% accuracy (precision) and 80% efficiency (recommendation potential) after perturbation.</details>

**_Lightweight Verification for Searchable Encryption_**  
Wang, B.; Fan, X.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Symmetric Searchable Encryption (SSE) is a promising primitive to securely perform keyword queries and to efficiently retrieve associated files from a curious server without sacrificing data privacy. Unfortunately, besides being curious, an untrusted server could also be malicious, which would return incorrect or incomplete results to a client. Since a client does not maintain its entire dataset locally after outsourcing, preventing malicious servers is necessary and challenging. In this paper, we propose a lightweight Verifiable SSE scheme, which can verify the correctness and completeness of keyword search results obtained from SSE against a malicious server. Our scheme not only achieves an asymptotically efficient verification time and communication overhead, but also outperforms previous solutions in practice. Moreover, our scheme can efficiently support updates on verification metadata. We formally define and analyze the security of our scheme, and conduct extensive experiments on massive datasets to demonstrate the efficiency of our scheme.</details>

**_Privacy Parameter Variation Using RAPPOR on a Malware Dataset_**  
Aaby, P.; Acuna, J. Mata De; Macfarlane, R.; Buchanan, W. J.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Stricter data protection regulations and the poor application of privacy protection techniques have resulted in a requirement for data-driven companies to adopt new methods of analysing sensitive user data. The RAPPOR (Randomized Aggregatable Privacy-Preserving Ordinal Response) method adds parameterised noise, which must be carefully selected to maintain adequate privacy without losing analytical value. This paper applies RAPPOR privacy parameter variations against a public dataset containing a list of running Android applications data. The dataset is filtered and sampled into small (10,000); medium (100,000); and large (1,200,000) sample sizes while applying RAPPOR with ? = 10; 1.0; and 0.1 (respectively low; medium; high privacy guarantees). Also, in order to observe detailed variations within high to medium privacy guarantees (? = 0.5 to 1.0), a second experiment is conducted by progressively adjusting the value of ? over the same populations. The first experiment verifies the original RAPPOR studies using ? = 1 with a non-existent recoverability in the small sample size, and detectable signal from medium to large sample sizes as also demonstrated in the original RAPPOR paper. Further results, using high privacy guarantees, show that the large sample size, in contrast to medium, suffers 2.75 times more in terms of recoverability when increasing privacy guarantees from ? = 1.0 to 0.8. Overall, the paper demonstrates that high privacy guarantees to restrict the analysis only to the most dominating strings.</details>

**_reclaimID: Secure, Self-Sovereign Identities Using Name Systems and Attribute-Based Encryption_**  
Schanzenbach, M.; Bramm, G.; Schütte, J.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this paper we present reclaimID: An architecture that allows users to reclaim their digital identities by securely sharing identity attributes without the need for a centralised service provider. We propose a design where user attributes are stored in and shared over a name system under user-owned namespaces. Attributes are encrypted using attribute-based encryption (ABE), allowing the user to selectively authorize and revoke access of requesting parties to subsets of his attributes. We present an implementation based on the decentralised GNU Name System (GNS) in combination with ciphertext-policy ABE using type-1 pairings. To show the practicality of our implementation, we carried out experimental evaluations of selected implementation aspects including attribute resolution performance. Finally, we show that our design can be used as a standard OpenID Connect Identity Provider allowing our implementation to be integrated into standard-compliant services.</details>

**_PUSC: Privacy-Preserving User-Centric Skyline Computation Over Multiple Encrypted Domains_**  
Liu, X.; Choo, K. R.; Deng, R. H.; Yang, Y.; Zhang, Y.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this paper, we present a new privacy-preserving user-centric skyline computation framework over different encrypted domains, which we referred to as PUSC. With PUSC, a user can flexibly obtain the skyline set from different service providers without disclosing user preferences to third parties in the system. Specifically, we introduce a secure user-defined vector dominance protocol to compare the vector dominance relationship between two encrypted vectors, according to user's preference. This serves as the core protocol in PUSC. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed PUSC achieves the goal of selecting skyline set according to authorized users' preferences without leaking their privacy to other parties. In addition, performance evaluation demonstrates PUSC's efficiency in terms of providing skyline computation and transmission while minimizing privacy disclosure.</details>

**_Capstone: Mobility Modeling on Smartphones to Achieve Privacy by Design_**  
Kulkarni, V.; Moro, A.; Chapuis, B.; Garbinato, B.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Sharing location traces with context-aware service providers has privacy implications. Location-privacy preserving mechanisms, such as obfuscation, anonymization and cryptographic primitives, have been shown to have impractical utility/privacy tradeoff. Another solution for enhancing user privacy is to minimize data sharing by executing the tasks conventionally carried out at the service providers' end on the users' smartphones. Although the data volume shared with the untrusted entities is significantly reduced, executing computationally demanding server-side tasks on resource-constrained smartphones is often impracticable. To this end, we propose a novel perspective on lowering the computational complexity by treating spatiotemporal trajectories as space-time signals. Lowering the data dimensionality facilitates offloading the computational tasks onto the digital-signal processors and the usage of the non-blocking signal-processing pipelines. While focusing on the task of user mobility modeling, we achieve the following results in comparison to the state of the art techniques: (i) mobility models with precision and recall greater than 80%, (ii) reduction in computational complexity by a factor of 2.5, and (iii) reduction in power consumption by a factor of 0.5. Using real-world mobility datasets, we demonstrate the suitability of our technique to function on smartphones.</details>

**_P-GENT: Privacy-Preserving Geocoding of Non-Geotagged Tweets_**  
Wang, S.; Sinnott, R.; Nepal, S.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>With the widespread proliferation of location-aware devices and social media applications, more and more people share information on location-based social networks such as Twitter. Such data can be beneficial to better plan and manage individual's activities and other social applications, e.g., location-based advertisement or recommendation. However, only a very small proportion of tweets are geotagged due to privacy concerns or lack of underlying positioning infrastructures. Hence it is meaningful to estimate the geographic information for non-geotagged tweets, i.e., geocoding, which can help to improve the applicability and utility of social media data. Contrary to existing geocoding approaches, this paper aims at the privacy risk and providing a fine-grained estimation. In this paper, we propose Privacy-preserving GEocoding of Non-geotagged Tweets (P-GENT) for geocoding non-geotagged tweets with fine-grained estimation whilst protecting privacy. Our approach estimates the geographic location of a non-geotagged tweet based on the similarities between the content of the tweet and the keyword lists of detected local events form the archived geo-tagged tweets during the same time period. This approach implements a spatio-temporal clustering algorithm to discover local events with a fine-grained granularity and an important keyword extraction mechanism to describe the detected local event. In addition, a density-seed discovery approach is used to reduce the sparseness of geo-tagged tweets and the time complexity of clustering approach. The experimental evaluation with real-world data demonstrates that our approach has at most 92% precision for one timeslot and 33-43% precision remained for all time slots after using privacy-preserving mechanisms.</details>

**_A Flow-Level Architecture for Balancing Accountability and Privacy_**  
Ma, Y.; Wu, Y.; Ge, J.; Li, J.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>With the rapid development of the Internet, flow-based approach has attracted more and more attention. To this end, this paper presents a new and efficient architecture to balance accountability and privacy based on network flows. A self-certifying identifier is proposed to efficiently identify a flow. In addition, a delegate-registry cooperation scheme and a multi-delegate mechanism are developed to ensure users' privacy. The effectiveness and overhead of the proposed architecture are evaluated by virtue of the real trace collected from an Internet service provider. The experimental results show that our architecture can achieve a better network performance in terms of lower resource consumption, lower response time, and higher stability.</details>

**_Asymmetric Commutative Encryption Scheme Based Efficient Solution to the Millionaires' Problem_**  
Liu, M.; Nanda, P.; Zhang, X.; Yang, C.; Yu, S.; Li, J.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Secure multiparty computation (SMC) is an important scheme in cryptography and can be applied in various real-life problems. The first SMC problem is the millionaires' problem which involves two-party secure computation. Because the efficiency of public key encryption scheme appears less than symmetric encryption scheme, most existing solutions based on public key cryptography to this problem is inefficient. Thus, a solution based on the symmetric encryption scheme has been proposed. Although it is claimed that this approach can be efficient and practical, we discover that there exist several severe security flaws in this solution. In this paper, we analyze the vulnerability of existing solutions, and propose a new scheme based on the Decisional Diffie-Hellman hypothesis (DDH). Our solution also uses two special encodings (0-encoding and 1-encoding) generated by our modified encoding method to reduce the computation cost of modular multiplications. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the efficiency of our solution, and the experimental results show that our solution can be much more efficient and be approximately 8000 times faster than the solution based on symmetric encryption scheme for a 32-bit input and short-term security. Moreover, our solution is also more efficient than the state-of-the-art solution.</details>

**_AuthStore: Password-Based Authentication and Encrypted Data Storage in Untrusted Environments_**  
Zeidler, C.; Asghar, M. R.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Passwords are widely used for client to server authentication as well as for encrypting data stored in untrusted environments, such as cloud storage. Both, authentication and encrypted cloud storage, are usually discussed in isolation. In this work, we propose AuthStore, a flexible authentication framework that allows users to securely reuse passwords for authentication as well as for encrypted cloud storage at a single or multiple service providers. Users can configure how secure passwords are protected using password stretching techniques. We present a compact password-authenticated key exchange protocol (CompactPAKE) that integrates the retrieval of password stretching parameters. A parameter attack is described and we show how existing solutions suffer from this attack. Furthermore, we introduce a password manager that supports CompactPAKE.</details>

**_SDLI: Static Detection of Leaks Across Intents_**  
Salvia, R.; Ferrara, P.; Spoto, F.; Cortesi, A.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Intents are Android's intra and inter-application communication mechanism. They specify an action to perform, with extra data, and are sent to a receiver component or broadcast to many components. Components, in the same or in a distinct app, receive the intent if they are available to perform the desired action. Hence, a sound static analyzer must be aware of information flows through intents. That can be achieved by considering intents as both source (when reading) and sink (when writing) of confidential data. But this is overly conservative if the intent stays inside the same app or if the set of apps installed on the device is known in advance. In such cases, a sound approximation of the flow of intents leads to a more precise analysis. This work describes SDLI, a novel static analyzer that, for each app, creates an XML summary file reporting a description of the tainted information in outwards intents and of the intents the app is available to serve. SDLI discovers confidential information leaks when two apps communicate, by matching their XML summaries, looking for tainted outwards intents of the first app that can be inwards intents of the second app. The tool is implemented inside Julia, an industrial static analyzer. On the DroidBench testcases, its shows a precision higher than 75%. On some popular apps from the Google Play marketplace, it spots inter-apps leaks of confidential data, hence showing its practical effectiveness.</details>

**_Software System Representation Methods Based on Algebraic Component_**  
Yu, Z.; Shan, C.; Mao, L.; Hu, C.; Xiong, W.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>To improve the ability to describe the dynamic behavior and interoperability of the artifacts, increase flexibility and security in software development and improve the productivity of software systems. This paper present a software system representation methods based on algebraic component. First, based on the perspective of complex network, the method abstracts the software system into software topological graph which takes information resources as vertex and takes its behavior as edges. Then, the paper uses the topological complex principle to abstract each node into six-tuple algebraic component. This algebraic component is divided into functional and join parts. The method also presents three operation relations including call operation, contained operation and nested operation. The paper gives a rigorous proof of algebraic component and its three kinds of operation. The results show that the algebraic component and its operation are complete, and can be algebraically expressed in any software system.</details>

**_A Lightweight Multi-precision Squaring on Embedded Processors for ECC_**  
Zhang, W.; Lin, D.; Zhang, H.; Zhou, X.; Gao, Y.; Chen, C.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this paper, we introduce a lightweight implementation of multi-precision squaring for Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) on resource-constrained devices. We present a new method named Complete Hybrid Karatsuba Squaring (CHKS) which follows subtractive Karatsuba structure, and use Vector-Like VL to compute small block squaring. VL has a slight advantage compared with traditional product-scanning squaring from 24-bit to 64-bit input. In order to achieve a lightweight multi-precision squaring, we make an optimized modification for Karatsuba squaring carefully. Our experimental results on 8-bit AVR microprocessor show that CHKS saves nearly half size of code while keeping 1%-9% faster speed compared with prior works.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>PDF is extensively employed worldwide in the current time. A vast number of PDF are disseminated over the Internet during people's exchange of documents. The private information that is hidden in PDF document structure is revealed with documents, which causes privacy leakage. To systematically analyze and address the issues, we conduct a series of studies. We find possible sources of PDF personal privacy leaks and design a methodology to extract and recognize sensitive information automatically. Our methodology is helpful for users to check whether their PDF documents contain privacy information prior to transmission via the Internet. We conduct an experiment, and the results indicate the effectiveness of our method. We then experiment tens of thousands of benign and malicious PDF documents gathered from multiple sources around the world to analyze the current privacy leakage situation of PDF documents. Our analysis demonstrates that nearly 70% of people lack the awareness of privacy protection when employing PDF documents. We also discuss the special usage of our method in cyberattack attribution.</details>

**_Website Fingerprinting by Power Estimation Based Side-Channel Attacks on Android 7_**  
Qin, Y.; Yue, C.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Power consumption data on smartphones can be used to infer user information like web browsing activities and location. Since the power consumption data was traditionally considered harmless to user privacy and developers need to use power information to develop energy-efficient apps, it can be obtained without user permission on Android systems older than Android 7. However, due to the updates in Android 7, the traditional methods of accessing power consumption data either don't work anymore or the data is coarse-grained, and less information can be leaked. In this paper, we propose a power estimation method and design a power estimation based side-channel attack to perform website fingerprinting. Results show that website fingerprinting can be performed with high accuracy using power estimation data on Android 7.</details>

**_Do You Like What I Like? Similarity Estimation in Proximity-Based Mobile Social Networks_**  
Beierle, F.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>While existing social networking services tend to connect people who know each other, people show a desire to also connect to yet unknown people in physical proximity. Existing research shows that people tend to connect to similar people. Utilizing technology in order to stimulate human interaction between strangers, we consider the scenario of two strangers meeting. On the example of similarity in musical taste, we develop a solution for the problem of similarity estimation in proximity-based mobile social networks. We show that a single exchange of a probabilistic data structure between two devices can closely estimate the similarity of two users - without the need to contact a third-party server. We introduce metrics for fast and space-efficient approximation of the Dice coefficient of two multisets - based on the comparison of two Counting Bloom Filters or two Count-Min Sketches. Our analysis shows that utilizing a single hash function minimizes the error when comparing these probabilistic data structures. The size that should be chosen for the data structure depends on the expected average number of unique input elements. Using real user data, we show that a Counting Bloom Filter with a single hash function and a length of 128 is sufficient to accurately estimate the similarity between two multisets representing the musical tastes of two users. Our approach is generalizable for any other similarity estimation of frequencies represented as multisets.</details>

**_Countering Intrusiveness Using New Security-Centric Ranking Algorithm Built on Top of Elasticsearch_**  
Mohsen, F.; Abdelhaq, H.; Bisgin, H.; Jolly, A.; Szczepanski, M.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Mobile computing is dominating the technology market and it is expected to continue growing. Mobile thirdparty applications without any doubt contribute vastly to this growth. However, intrusive apps that tend to ask for plenty of permissions are becoming a common trend that influence the privacy of mobile users. Solutions have been proposed to detect and remove malicious apps from online markets or detect them after being installed. Yet, dealing with intrusive apps requires high user involvement and best judgment and comprehension. There have been a very few works that aim at helping mobile users make calculated decisions to avoid intrusive apps. In this paper, we are proposing and evaluating a new security-centric ranking algorithm built on top of the Elasticsearch engine to assist users evade installing intrusive apps. The algorithm calculates an intrusiveness score for an app based on its requested permissions, received system actions, and on the privacy preferences of users. In doing so, we are proposing a new approach to capture users' privacy preferences. The approach is evaluated through an online user study. The ranking algorithm is being evaluated on a large corpus of Android apps contextual data and APK files by conducting a pilot study and benchchmarking study. The results show that the scoring and reranking steps add very small overhead. Moreover, participants of the online and pilot studies gave positive feedback for the ranking algorithm and privacy preferences solicitation approach. The results suggest that our proposal would definitely protect the privacy of mobile users and pushes developers into requesting the minimum privileges that are required for their apps to function.</details>

**_A Concept and Evaluation of Usable and Fine-Grained Privacy-Friendly Cookie Settings Interface_**  
Kulyk, O.; Mayer, P.; Volkamer, M.; Käfer, O.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>As cookies are commonly used on websites, they can constitute a significant threat to user's privacy by tracking surfing behaviour. The browsers provide a variety of options for cookie settings, thereby potentially enabling the user to execute some control over the extent of being tracked. However, studies show that the interfaces for these settings are often deemed too confusing or complex for lay users, often failing to provide necessary explanations, and therefore preventing the users from properly using these setting interfaces to protect themselves against tracking. In this paper, we present a concept for a privacy-friendly cookie setting interface that is meant to support the user in configuring their cookie settings. The setting interface in our concept (1) uses an assistant to guide the user towards their preferred cookie settings via a series of questions; and (2) enables the user to set their cookie settings manually, providing explanations for each of the options available to the user, including the potential advantages and disadvantages of each option. To gauge the viability of the proposal, the concept has been implemented as a Chrome extension and evaluated in a user study with 21 participants. The results have shown, that the extension is well received by the participants and provides better usability than the standard cookie settings interface in Chrome.</details>

**_Highly Efficient Privacy-Preserving Key Agreement for Wireless Body Area Networks_**  
Khan, H.; Dowling, B.; Martin, K. M.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In 2012, the IEEE introduced IEEE Std 802.15.6 as the communication standard for Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). All key agreement protocols offered by this standard have been shown to exhibit grave security weaknesses. However, to date, no key agreement protocol has been proposed which fulfills all the requisite security and privacy objectives for deployment in a resource constrained WBAN environment. In this paper, based upon symmetric cryptographic primitives only, a key agreement protocol is presented which, in addition to good performance also offers the desirable privacy attributes of node anonymity and session unlinkability. The protocol is also suitable for post-quantum deployment scenarios as it is independent of any public key based operations.</details>

Wang, Y.; Adams, S.; Beling, P.; Greenspan, S.; Rajagopalan, S.; Velez-Rojas, M.; Mankovski, S.; Boker, S.; Brown, D.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Preserving privacy in machine learning on multi-party data is of importance to many domains. In practice, existing solutions suffer from several critical limitations, such as significantly reduced utility under privacy constraints or excessive communication burden between the information fusion center and local data providers. In this paper, we propose and implement a new distributed deep learning framework that addresses these shortcomings and preserves privacy more efficiently than previous methods. During the stochastic gradient descent training of a deep neural network, we focus on the parameters with large absolute gradients in order to save privacy budget consumption. We adopt a generalization of the Report-Noisy-Max algorithm in differential privacy to select these gradients and prove its privacy guarantee rigorously. Inspired by the recent novel idea of Terngrad, we also quantize the released gradients to ternary levels -B, 0, B, where B is the bound of gradient clipping. Applying Terngrad can significantly reduce the communication cost without incurring severe accuracy loss. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of our method on a real-world credit card fraud detection data set consisting of millions of transactions.</details>

**_Track me if you can? Query Based Dual Location Privacy in VANETs for V2V and V2I_**  
Arif, M.; Wang, G.; Peng, T.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In the Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs), a vehicle or the vehicle driver could be recognized and tracked by eavesdropping its queries (e.g., beacons) by an adversary, since these quires contain personal information and data such as the queries and location of the vehicle. This attack leads to threats on the vehicles location privacy. The current solutions, exercises Anonymizer, a third trusted party (TTP) in between the LBS and the vehicles. The insertion of the TTP shifts the endangered entity from the LBS to the Anonymizer, regarding security risk, and with the jeopardized anonymizer, the vehicles or vehicles drivers related data will also be at risk. In this paper, we come up with efficient query based dual location privacy in VANETs for V2V and V2I communication. In which we use the circle based dummy generation (CBDG) algorithm along with TTP. Before sending the query to the TTP first we create some dummy location by using CBDG, because we cannot trust completely on TTP architecture. And then we use CASPER as TTP to process the desired query from vehicles to LBS. after receiving the processed query from the LBS, the TTP sends the results back to the drives, where the vehicle drivers finds their desired results. Our results shows that the proposed scheme preserve the location privacy based on the queries at low communication and computational cost.</details>

**_QueryGuard: Privacy-Preserving Latency-Aware Query Optimization for Edge Computing_**  
Xu, R.; Palanisamy, B.; Joshi, J.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The emerging edge computing paradigm has enabled applications having low response time requirements to meet the quality of service needs of applications by moving the computations to the edge of the network that is geographically closer to the end-users and end-devices. Despite the low latency advantages provided by the edge computing model, there are significant privacy risks associated with the adoption of edge computing services for applications dealing with sensitive data. In contrast to cloud data centers where system infrastructures are managed through strict and regularized policies, edge computing nodes are scattered geographically and may not have the same degree of regulatory and monitoring oversight. This can lead to higher privacy risks for the data processed and stored at the edge nodes, thus making them less trusted. In this paper, we show that a direct application of traditional performance-based query optimization techniques in edge computing can lead to unexpected data disclosure risks at the edge nodes. We propose a new privacy-preserving latency-aware query optimization framework, QueryGuard, that simultaneously tackles the privacy-aware distributed query processing problem while optimizing the queries for latency. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that QueryGuard achieves better performance in terms of execution time and memory usage than conventional distributed query optimization techniques while also enforcing the required constraints related to data privacy.</details>

**_PMDA: Privacy-Preserving Multi-functional Data Aggregation Without TTP in Smart Grid_**  
He, Z.; Pan, S.; Lin, D.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In the smart grid, residents' electricity usage needs to be periodically measured and reported for the purpose of better energy management. At the same time, real-time collection of residents' electricity consumption may unfavorably incur privacy leakage, which has motivated the research on privacy-preserving aggregation of electricity readings. Most previous studies either rely on a trusted third party (TTP) or suffer from expensive computation. In this paper, we first reveal the privacy flaws of a very recent scheme pursing privacy preservation without relying on the TTP. By presenting concrete attacks, we show that this scheme has failed to meet the design goals. Then, for better privacy protection, we construct a new scheme called PMDA, which utilizes Shamir's secret sharing to allow smart meters to negotiate aggregation parameters in the absence of a TTP. Using only lightweight cryptography, PMDA efficiently supports multi-functional aggregation of the electricity readings, and simultaneously preserves residents' privacy. Theoretical analysis is provided with regard to PMDA's security and efficiency. Moreover, experimental data obtained from a prototype indicates that our proposal is efficient and feasible for practical deployment.</details>

**_Understanding the Performance and Challenges of DNS Query Name Minimization_**  
Wang, Z.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>As a promising solution to DNS privacy, query name minimization limits the unnecessary leakage of query name information in DNS requests. Due to the lack of detailed measurement study, there is little understanding of the performance, compatibility, and security implications of query name minimization. In this paper, we measure the performance of query name minimization. We find that query name minimization requires a significant query increase but NXDOMAIN optimization technique can alleviate the increase. We propose a DDoS vulnerability with query name minimization and evaluate its impacts and defenses using NXDOMAIN optimization. Broken empty non-terminals are measured and identified as the critical obstacles to the transition to query name minimization.</details>

**_Toward a Secure Access to 5G Network_**  
Liu, F.; Peng, J.; Zuo, M.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>5G networks are anticipated to be commercially deployed worldwide for establishing a massively connected society in the year 2020. To enable a user to securely access to network is a vital prerequisite to operate a 5G network. Recent research results have uncovered a number of security vulnerabilities when a user gains access to 3G or 4G networks, e.g. leakage of long-term key, privacy of subscriber identifier, insecurity of links between mobile network operators, linkability attacks. Such weaknesses should be mitigated in the 5G network. In this paper, we present a novel scheme used for 5G attach procedure to address these issues without relying on a global public key infrastructure. The significant advantage of the proposed scheme over existing solutions is that all security issues around the attach procedure can be addressed in one scheme without relying on a PKI.</details>

**_Fast Time Series Discords Detection with Privacy Preserving_**  
Zhang, C.; Yin, A.; Wu, Y.; Chen, Y.; Wang, X.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Discords are the most inconsistent subsequences from others in time series data. In this paper, we propose an efficient scheme to detect time series discords with considering privacy protection in the case of multi-party participation. In our solution, we divide the detection task into two parts, one is that each data owner transforms their time series data into transaction tables based on SAX. For each transaction table, data owners make use of BCP cryptosystem, cryptographic hash function, and random disturbance to construct encrypted transaction tables, which are sent to the cloud. The other is that the cloud will execute our algorithm FMDP to obtain the discord scores of subsequences based on these received transaction tables. Since data is reduced before sent to the cloud, our solution greatly reduces cloud computing costs and communication costs. Our experimental results show that our approach can not only effectively find time series discords, but also greatly improve the computation efficiency without leaking any privacy</details>

**_An Efficient Blacklistable Anonymous Credential System with Reputation Using Pairing-Based Accumulator_**  
Nakanishi, T.; Kanatani, T.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>To achieve the privacy-enhancing authentications without any TTP (Trusted Third Party), blacklistable anonymous credential systems have been proposed. In conventional blacklistable anonymous credential systems, a user is blacklisted after the user misbehaves once. Since it is too harsh to be of practical use, extended blacklistable anonymous credential systems based on reputation have been proposed. In the reputation-based system, each behavior of a user is given a score. The service provider publishes a reputation list of correspondences between session ID and the score. In the authentication, a user can anonymously prove the total of his own scores. However, the previously proposed systems have the efficiency problem: The authentication data size is O(|L|) or O(K), where |L| is the size of the reputation list L, and K is the size of the following window. In the window type of systems, the authentication is based on a window with most recent K authentications of the user. When a past authentication becomes outside the window, the misbehaving of the authentication is forgiven. Thus, K should be as large as possible. Therefore, the previous systems suffer from O(|L|) or O(K)-size data in each authentication. In addition, in the previous systems, the authentication needs the computation of O(|L|) or O(K) exponentiations, which is heavy. In this paper, an efficient blacklistable anonymous credential system with reputation is proposed. In our system, the data size of the authentication does not depend on parameters such as |L| and K, and is O(1). Furthermore, although the computational costs in the authentication depend on some parameters, the parameter-related costs are only multiplications instead of exponentiations. For constructing our system, we newly introduce the concept of an accumulator for reputation, and show an efficient pairing-based construction. Using the accumulator, we construct the efficient blacklistable anonymous credential system with reputation.</details>

**_Privacy-Preserving Data Synchronization Using Tensor-Based Fully Homomorphic Encryption_**  
Gai, K.; Wu, Y.; Zhu, L.; Qiu, M.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>A connected environment brings a challenge of the privacy for data synchronizations as multiple unexpected/unpredictable parties maybe involved the process of the data usage. Outsourcing tasks results in data uncontrollability and privacy concerns, since service vendors generally have an access to the data stored in the server. Thus, unencrypted data in the third-party server are facing a threat of the privacy leakage due to various potential causes. In this paper, we focus on the privacy leakage issue in data synchronizations, more specifically speaking, to address designing a privacy-preserving method for data multi-storage with a homomorphism capability. The proposed scheme utilizes a tensor-based Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) that balances privacy protections and functionalities. Design objectives are threefold: the proposed method can (i) protect data owners' privacy, (ii) support arithmetic operations, and (iii) achieve real-time data synchronization. The expected application scenario is synchronizing owner's data with remote servers in cloud computing. Both theoretical proofs and experiment evaluations have been processed in order to examine the adoptability and correctness of our approach.</details>

**_Towards Domain-Specific and Privacy-Preserving Qualified eID in a User-Centric Identity Model_**  
Lenz, T.; Krnjic, V.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Unique and qualified identification is essential in numerous security-critical areas, like eGovernment, or eBusiness. Therefore, many countries have already deployed eID solutions to confirm identity information of entities and to increase trust into the identity information. Many of these confirmation solutions only support an all-or-nothing disclosure, which means that selective disclosure of single attributes is not possible. Some other work has dealt with this privacy issue by using anonymous credentials or malleable signatures. However, all of these solutions lacks in flexible generation of qualified and provable pseudonyms that based on confirmed eID information. In this paper, we propose an advanced and lightweight model for user-centric and qualified identity information that facilitates selective disclosure and domain-specific altering of single identity attributes in order to protect the citizen's privacy. We illustrate the practical applicability of our model by implementing all components as prototype applications. Finally, we evaluate our model and compare it with other approaches for selective disclosure.</details>

**_RZKPB: A Privacy-Preserving Blockchain-Based Fair Transaction Method for Sharing Economy_**  
Li, B.; Wang, Y.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Emerging blockchain systems have been widely adopted in sharing economy, such as e-commerce, to allow mutually distrustful parties to transact fairly without trusted parties. Most blockchain systems, however, lack transactional privacy protection. All transactions, including trading relationship between pseudonyms and content transacted, are exposed on the blockchain. Although many existing privacy protection methods on the blockchain have been proposed, it is difficult to find a trade-off between keeping speed and protecting privacy of transactions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel privacy-preserving method RZKPB that does not store financial transactions in clear on the blockchain, thus retaining transactional privacy from the public's view. Meanwhile, these transactions are as proofs to solve disputes between trading partners. RZKPB ensures fairness and privacy of transactions between participants without adding a new trusted party and breaking the verifying protocol on the blockchain. We take the e-commerce as an example in sharing economy to introduce RZKPB in our paper. Our experimental results show that compared with existing privacy-preserving methods based on the blockchain, RZKPB is more efficient under different settings.</details>

**_Towards a User-Friendly and Secure Hand Shaking Authentication for Smartphones_**  
Yan, J.; Qi, Y.; Rao, Q.; Qi, S.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Hand shaking authentication is a novel authentication method based on user behavior with mobile phone, however previous works commonly require users to repeat their actions dozens of times as dataset to train a machine learning model, causing unfriendly user experience. In this paper, we propose an efficient authentication method based on hand shaking, in which the user only needs to shake phones twice before use. The training set expands dynamically by adding samples when users successfully authenticate. A challenge is to achieve low FPR starting with very few training samples, which we referred as the cold start problem. In response, we present DTW-LSTM Online Stacking (DLOS), an ensemble authentication model which finely combines DTW with LSTM to create an accurate and robust classifier both on the cold start phase and the subsequent phase. The intuition is that DTW algorithm performs well enough with few samples while LSTM's performance improves significantly when the dataset grows. In DLOS, we introduce dataset_size φ as the meta-feature to online adjust weights of DTW and LSTM as the dataset grows. DTW plays a leading role in the cold start phase and LSTM dominates in the subsequent phase. Experimental results show that this method has a superior performance while saving the cost for usage, and it could effectively resist the shoulder surfing attack.</details>

**_A Flexible Mix-Zone Selection Scheme Towards Trajectory Privacy Protection_**  
Chen, Z.; Fu, Y.; Zhang, M.; Zhang, Z.; Li, H.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The wide application of trajectory analysis research greatly promotes the trajectory dataset publishing which in the meantime carries out tremendous privacy leakage problems, especially those come with long-term pseudonyms. Mix-zone is a typical privacy protection approach in road network that enables a group of users switch to new pseudonyms in certain area. However, to ensure unlinkability between all incoming and all outgoing sub-trajectories, strict restrictions are defined which limits the number of qualified mix-zones. Additionally, the privacy of sub-trajectories is not further considered. In this paper, we propose a flexible trajectory partition scheme called Mix-STC which can find out more candidate mix-zones by means of three-dimensional spatiotemporal cubes calculation. Mix-STC provides privacy protection by limiting the length of sub-trajectories and perturbing the precise location of its end points. Experiments show that Mix-STC performs much better than original data in two different types of de-anonymization attacks. Our performance experiments demonstrate that the datasets processed by Mix-STC can still support typical trajectory applications well.</details>

**_PHeDHA: Protecting Healthcare Data in Health Information Exchanges with Active Data Bundles_**  
Fadheel, W.; Salih, R.; Lilien, L.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) collect and disseminate electronic patient healthcare data (EHRs/EMRs) among different healthcare providers to improve the quality and reduce the cost of healthcare services. However, the dissemination of patient data raises privacy and security concerns due to ease of copying and unauthorized dissemination of electronic data. This paper proposes a HIE system called PHeDHA (Protecting Healthcare Data in HIEs with Active Data Bundles), which provides privacy and security protection for patient data during their transmission via an HIE among different healthcare providers. PHeDHA uses as its basis the scheme named Active Data Bundles with Trusted Third Party (ADB-TTP). As the name suggests, ADB-TTP is based on an integration of a trusted third party (TTP) with Active Data Bundles (ADBs). An ADB is a software object that keeps patient healthcare data as sensitive data; includes metadata describing these sensitive data and prescribing their use (via data access and privacy policies specified within metadata); and encompasses a policy enforcement engine (called a virtual machine or VM), which controls and manages how the ADB behaves. In particular, the VM assures ADB's data integrity and enforces its policies specified as a part of metadata. We describe and discuss the conceptual model for PHeDHA, based on ADB-TTP. We are currently evaluating PHeDHA via simulation experiments.</details>

**_Monero Ring Attack: Recreating Zero Mixin Transaction Effect_**  
Wijaya, D. A.; Liu, J.; Steinfeld, R.; Liu, D.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Monero is one of the privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies employing CryptoNote protocol. The privacy features in Monero are provided by cryptographic techniques such as linkable ring signature and one-time public key. Recent studies show that the majority of Monero inputs are traceable prior to mandatory RingCT transaction. After the RingCT was implemented, the problems were mitigated. We propose a novel attack to reduce the anonymity of Monero transactions or even to fully deanonymise the inputs. The proposed protocol can be launched in RingCT protocol and enables multiple attackers to collaborate without trusting each other. The attack scheme can be planted in the existing Monero services without extra fees and without putting the users' money at risk.</details>

**_PANDORA: Preserving Privacy in PRNU-Based Source Camera Attribution_**  
Mohanty, M.; Zhang, M.; Asghar, M. R.; Russello, G.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) noise-based source camera attribution is a popular digital forensic method. In this method, a camera fingerprint computed from a set of known images of the camera is matched against the extracted noise of an anonymous questionable image to find if the camera had taken the anonymous image. The possibility of privacy leak, however, is one of the main concerns of the PRNU-based method. Using the camera fingerprint (or the extracted noise), an adversary can identify the owner of the camera by matching the fingerprint with the noise of an image (or with the fingerprint computed from a set of images) crawled from a social media account. In this paper, we address this privacy concern by encrypting both the fingerprint and the noise using the Boneh-Goh-Nissim (BGN) encryption scheme, and performing the matching in encrypted domain. To overcome leakage of privacy from the content of an image that is used in the fingerprint calculation, we compute the fingerprint within a trusted environment, such as ARM TrustZone. We present PANDORA that aims at minimizing privacy loss and allows authorized forensic experts to perform camera attribution.</details>

**_Identifying Passive Message Fingerprint Attacks via Honey Challenge in Collaborative Intrusion Detection Networks_**  
Li, W.; Meng, W.; Wang, Y.; Kwok, L. F.; Lu, R.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>To enhance the detection capability of a single intrusion detection system (IDS), collaborative intrusion detection networks (CIDNs) have been exploited and developed via enabling a set of IDS nodes to exchange information with each other. In CIDNs, challenge-based trust mechanism has been considered as one promising solution to identify malicious nodes by evaluating the satisfaction levels between challenges and responses. However, such mechanism is still vulnerable to some advanced insider attacks like passive message fingerprint attack (PMFA), which is deemed as an advanced attack on challenge-based CIDNs by collecting messages and identifying normal requests in a passive way. In this work, we focus on PMFA and design Honey Challenge, an improved challenge mechanism for challenge-based CIDNs characterized by sending challenges in a similar way of sending normal requests, in such a way malicious nodes cannot accurately identify the normal requests. In the evaluation, we investigate the attack performance under both simulated and real network environments. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed mechanism can identify malicious nodes under PMFA and decrease their trust values in a quick manner.</details>

**_Testing Cryptographically Secure Pseudo Random Number Generators with Artificial Neural Networks_**  
Fischer, T.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present a new way of testing Random Number Generators (RNGs). Our approach allows to test Pseudo Random Number Generators (PRNGs) including Cryptographically Secure Pseudo Random Number Generators (CSPRNGs). The paper describes how to use machine learning for this. To construct a tester we compare the properties of three most common learning techniques to find the one most suitable one for testing RNGs. By analyzing the system during training and regarding the expected behavior of random numbers, we define an optimizer for learning RNGs. Based on the results and regarding the behavior of the machine learning algorithm, we define a rating for RNGs. On a state-of-the-art GPU cluster, we evaluate the full tester for multiple PRNGs. Additionally, we compare the results with the results from the commonly used test suite dieharder. The results prove that the developed tester is suitable for testing random numbers. In comparison to dieharder, it is even more powerful and able to replace it. Our tester could disclose weaknesses in PRNGs that are wrongly considered as CSPRNG. This could increase the security of many cryptographic protocols based on random numbers.</details>

**_IRTED-TL: An Inter-Region Tax Evasion Detection Method Based on Transfer Learning_**  
Zhu, X.; Yan, Z.; Ruan, J.; Zheng, Q.; Dong, B.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Tax evasion detection plays a crucial role in addressing tax revenue loss. Many efforts have been made to develop tax evasion detection models by leveraging machine learning techniques, but they have not constructed a uniform model for different geographical regions because an ample supply of training examples is a fundamental prerequisite for an effective detection model. When sufficient tax data are not readily available, the development of a representative detection model is more difficult due to unequal feature distributions in different regions. Existing methods face a challenge in explaining and tracing derived results. To overcome these challenges, we propose an Inter-Region Tax Evasion Detection method based on Transfer Learning (IRTED-TL), which is optimized to simultaneously augment training data and induce interpretability into the detection model. We exploit evasion-related knowledge in one region and leverage transfer learning techniques to reinforce the tax evasion detection tasks of other regions in which training examples are lacking. We provide a unified framework that takes advantage of auxiliary data using a transfer learning mechanism and builds an interpretable classifier for inter-region tax evasion detection. Experimental tests based on real-world tax data demonstrate that the IRTED-TL can detect tax evaders with higher accuracy and better interpretability than existing methods.</details>

**_One Intrusion Detection Method Based On Uniformed Conditional Dynamic Mutual Information_**  
Lu, L.; Zhu, X.; Zhang, X.; Liu, J.; Bhuiyan, M. Z. A.; Cui, G.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>With the rapid development of our society, World Wide Web has turned to be an indispensible part of our daily life. Meanwhile, the network security is becoming more and more important. Intrusion Detection System (IDS), which serves to detect the abnormal activities in computers and internet, is often used to solve the network security problems. However, the IDS has to face and process the high dimensional data with high redundancy due to the increasing scale and dimension of the data, which causes the low efficiency of IDS. This paper proposes a new feature selection method for intrusion detection based on the Uniformed Conditional Dynamic Mutual Information (UCDMIFS), which can highly decrease the dimensionality and increase the detection accuracy. To examine our algorithm, the UCDMIFS algorithm is applied to the KDD Cup 99 data set and compared with other algorithms, such as support vector machine (SVM), to detect the intrusions. The experiments illustrate the efficiency of our algorithm.</details>

**_Cyber Identity: Salient Trait Ontology and Computational Framework to Aid in Solving Cybercrime_**  
Michel, M. C.; Carvalho, M.; Crawford, H.; Esterline, A. C.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Cyber forensics is challenging due to the lack of defined holistic features with a ground truth identity core, and scalable systematic methods to credibly link a person's physical and cyber attributes in a complex networked environment. Cybercrime continues to grow as humans conduct more online activities that generate sensitive data while connected to anyone around the world. In this work, we propose a new classification-based ontology and computational framework for resolving an identity based on cyber activities. Our ontology and framework extend legal case situational theory research to temporally map cyber and physical categorical traits. Initial experimentation based on real-world legal cases reveals contextual salient traits that are most effective in linking evidence to a person's profile or unique identity. As a result, these multi-dimensional traits support innovative visualizations that depict a person's linkable identity core, digital artifacts, security, and technology. The impact of our ontology and framework design is to support solving cybercrime by aiding in identity resolution.</details>

**_Enabling Trust in Deep Learning Models: A Digital Forensics Case Study_**  
K, A.; Grzonkowski, S.; Lekhac, N.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Today, the volume of evidence collected per case is growing exponentially, to address this problem forensics investigators are looking for investigation process with tools built on new technologies like big data, cloud services, and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. Consequently, the accuracy of artifacts found also relies on the performance of techniques used, especially DL models. Recently, Deep Neural Nets (DNN) have achieved state of the art performance in the tasks of classification and recognition. In the context of digital forensics, DNN has been applied in the domains of cybercrime investigation such as child abuse investigations, malware classification, steganalysis and image forensics. However, the robustness of DNN models in the context of digital forensics is never studied before. Hence, in this research, we design and implement a domain-independent Adversary Testing Framework (ATF) to test security robustness of black-box DNN's. By using ATF, we also methodically test a commercially available DNN service used in forensic investigations and bypass the detection, where published methods fail in control settings.</details>

**_Bluetooth Low Energy Used for Memory Acquisition from Smart Health Care Devices_**

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Many smart health devices implement Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) due to the benefits of low power usage, ease of implementation and ease of transfer of data to their mobile devices. Theses devices store records that may contain useful information in a criminal investigation, investigators could acquire from a range of smart health care devices to debate the users last movements. However, it is difficult to obtain this data, as there are currently no tools or methods. In this work we present a novel acquisition method, using BLE to collect records stored on smart Blood Pressure Monitors (BPM). We did further experiments to test the robustness and reliability of this method on two other BPMs. We identified a realistic use case on how this method can be useful in practice.</details>

**_Resilient Bipartite Consensus for Multi-agent Networks with Antagonistic Interactions_**  
Liu, H.; Xu, M.; Wu, Y.; Zheng, N.; Chen, Y.; Bhuiyan, M. Z. A.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>This paper addresses the problem of resilient bipartite consensus for multi-agent networks in the presence of misbehaving nodes. The bipartite consensus problem was first studied by C. Altafini, and has been extensively studied in recent years. The interaction representing the communication between two agents is characterized by edge weights in a signed directed graph where the positive weight of an edge implies cooperation between the two agents while a negative one corresponds to antagonism. Resilient consensus problems without antagonistic interactions have been exhaustively studied, while the security problem of bipartite consensus, to the best of our knowledge, has not been studied yet. In this paper, we extend the resilient consensus problem to the case when antagonistic interactions exist. The developed results which are applicable for multi-agent systems with continuous-time dynamics shows that all normal nodes reach resilient bipartite consensus if the associated signed digraph is structurally balanced and has sufficient connectivity in terms of robustness. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate our results.</details>

**_An Efficient Distributed Approach on High Dimensional Data Similarity Searchable Encryption_**  
Guo, C.; Tang, X.; Chen, Y.; Tian, P.; Bhuiyan, M. Z. Alam
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Due to the rapid development of cloud computing, how to perform efficient similarity retrieval on high-dimensional encrypted data has extensive application value. And because the data size that many applications are facing has grown at a geometric level, traditional centralized algorithms can not meet the needs of users. In this paper, we present a distributed similar searchable encryption scheme for high-dimensional data. Our method takes advantage of local sensitive hashing (LSH) to reduce the dimensions and make a fast similar neighbor searching. Then random vector dot product and homomorphic encryption techniques are used to design a specific encryption index structures so that a more rigorous privacy definition can be satisfied. The index building and searching algorithms are all implemented under the MapReduce framework to ensure the high scalability during processing of massive data. Through the analysis of experimental results of real data, the presented scheme can effectively perform similar retrieval on cipher text while protecting privacy.</details>

Koehl, A.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Autoblogging is the process of running automated scripts against established content sources or syndicated feeds and compiling the information into blog sites. Unfortunately, unlike mashups which seek to enhance the Internet experience by coalescing disparate content sources in novel ways, a criminal ecosystem is evolving to profit off of the associated technologies. By scraping content en-masse from legitimate ad supported websites and removing the ads, attribution, and by rewriting links, a malicious site can impersonate a legitimate site, yet with their own ads for profit. We introduce a forensic approach to help solve the problem of traceability when content is stolen en masse from one site and hosted on another. Content is first minified and then watermarked repeatedly with unique identifiers using a sparse encoding tailored to the user's available steganographic bandwidth. When scraped content is discovered, the encoded identifiers can be traced back to specific events in server logs, as a powerful aid in identifying perpetrators and to help combat this practice.</details>

**_Managed Blockchain Based Cryptocurrencies with Consensus Enforced Rules and Transparency_**  
Mell, P.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Blockchain based cryptocurrencies are usually unmanaged, distributed, consensus-based systems in which no single entity has control. Managed cryptocurrencies can be implemented using private blockchains but are fundamentally different as the owners have complete control to do arbitrary activity without transparency (since they control the mining). In this work we explore a hybrid approach where a managed cryptocurrency is maintained through distributed consensus based methods. The currency administrator can perform ongoing management functions while the consensus methods enforce the rules of the cryptocurrency and provide transparency for all management actions. This enables the introduction of money management features common in fiat currencies but where the managing entity cannot perform arbitrary actions and transparency is enforced. We thus eliminate the need for users to trust the currency administrator but also to enable the administrator to manage the cryptocurrency. We demonstrate how to implement our approach through modest modifications to the implicit Bitcoin specification, however, our approach can be applied to most any blockchain based cryptocurrency using a variety of consensus methods.</details>

In this work, we design a blockchain-based data storage and access framework for PingER (worldwide end-to-end Internet performance measurement project) to remove its total dependence on a centralized repository. We use the permissioned blockchain and Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) for this purpose. In the proposed framework, metadata of the files are stored on the blockchain whereas the actual files are stored off-chain through DHT at multiple locations using a peer-to-peer network of PingER Monitoring Agents. This will provide decentralized storage, distributed processing, and efficient lookup capabilities to the PingER framework.</details>

**_Learning and Applying Ontology for Machine Learning in Cyber Attack Detection_**  
Zheng, H.; Wang, Y.; Han, C.; Le, F.; He, R.; Lu, J.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In cyber security, the ontology is invented to provide vocabulary in a generalized machine-processable language for downstream works such as attack detection. Meanwhile, machine learning (ML) as a promising intelligent field, is widely investigated to achieve the automation of these tasks. Existing ML-based methods suffer from confines of specific data and preprocessing, while applying ontology with machine learning methods is still rarely discussed. In this paper, 1) we propose a novel approach for automatic attack detection by generating ontology with deep learning through neural network embeddings; 2) we validate the learned ontology by comparing it with a manual ontology built by security expert, the results demonstrates that the latent representation learned with neural networks could serve as a novel ontology format so as to provide a generalized machine-processable language for downstream works, which is the intention of the ontology; 3) finally, we develop a platform to achieve the entire intelligent ontology learning and utilization for cyber attack detection. Our experimental results shows that our proposed ontology is promising to collaborate with machine learning based methods in order to improve the intelligent intrusion detection for cyber security.</details>

**_Practical K Nearest Neighbor Query Scheme with Two-Party Guarantees in Road Networks_**

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In order to achieve user's privacy preservation and data security of LBS server in road networks, a query scheme for points of interest(PoI) is proposed in this paper based on oblivious transfer and private information retrieval. The scheme can proceed in two phases: Firstly, we take vertexes in road networks as generating elements to construct a new data structure which is employed to store the distribution information and details of PoIs which are encrypted with different symmetric keys for sake of data security of LBS server. And an oblivious transfer protocol is presented based on the data structure, which facilitates a user to privately obtain the unique key materials corresponding to his interested PoIs without revealing any other PoI information in LBS server since the data is its asset. Then, a private information retrieval protocol is presented to obtain the interested PoI details, the user does not need to provide his location or explicit query content in the query, whereas he can derive an accurate result with the previous key materials, so it guarantees the user's privacy as well. Finally, performance analysis and experiments show that our scheme is more efficient and accurate in a real scenario compared with existing solutions.</details>

Junior, M. A. Simplicio; Cominetti, E. Lopes; Patil, H. Kupwade; Ricardini, J.; Ferraz, L.; Silva, M. V.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Vehicular communication (V2X) technologies are expected to become increasingly common in the future. Although they enable improvements on transportation safety and efficiency, the large scale deployment of V2X requires addressing some challenges. In particular, to prevent abuse by drivers and by the system itself, V2X architectures must: (1) ensure the authenticity of messages, which is usually accomplished by means of digital certification; and (2) preserve the privacy of honest users, so owners of non-revoked certificates cannot be easily identified or tracked by eavesdroppers. A promising design to address these requirements is the Security Credential Management System (SCMS), which is currently among the main candidates for protecting V2X communications in the United States. Even though SCMS provides efficient, scalable and privacy-preserving mechanisms for managing V2X-oriented certificates, in this paper we show that it can be further enhanced. Namely, we present two birthday attacks against SCMS's certificate revocation process, both of which degrade the system's security as time passes and more certificates are revoked. We then describe an alternative design to prevent such security degradation with minimal computational overhead. In complement to these security gains, we also describe a mechanism for improving the flexibility of revocation, allowing certificates (as well as their owner's privacy) to be temporarily revoked in an efficient manner. This functionality is useful, for example, to implement suspension mechanisms or to aid in investigations by law-enforcement authorities.</details>

**_Blockchain as a Notarization Service for Data Sharing with Personal Data Store_**  
Chowdhury, M. J. M.; Colman, A.; Kabir, M. A.; Han, J.; Sarda, P.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Personal data such as electronic medical records and academic records are critical and sensitive private information. These personal information is usually hosted across many data-custodian systems. Personal Data Store (PDS) is a service that lets an individual store, manage and deploy their key personal data in a highly secure and structured way. It also gives the user a central point of control for their personal information. One of the inherent problems of digital records is that it can be easily forged. Therefore, the data-consumer(with whom the data is shared) often needs to verify the authenticity of the shared document/record by communicating with the document/certificate issuing authority (e.g., data custodian). However, this process is time consuming and inefficient. In recent time, blockchain has gained tremendous attention from both industry and academia for distributed recording and immutable transactions. Blockchain provides a shared, immutable and transparent history of transactions enabling the building of applications that incorporate trust, accountability and transparency. This provides a unique opportunity to develop a secure and trustable data sharing system using blockchain. However, blockchain is primarily proposed for publicly verifiable transactions and does not provide privacy to the individuals. In this paper, we propose a data sharing framework that will guarantee the authenticity of the shared data in real-time and provide transactional privacy in a blockchain network. We have implemented our framework in a prototype that ensures privacy, integrity, and fine-grained access control over the shared data. The proposed work can significantly reduce the turnaround time for data sharing, improve the decision making process and reduce the overall cost.</details>

**_Superscalar Encrypted RISC: The Measure of a Secret Computer_**  
Breuer, P.; Bowen, J.; Palomar, E.; Liu, Z.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Appropriately modifying the arithmetic in a processor causes data to remain in encrypted form throughout processing, providing a technical approach to privacy for the ordinary user against the operator and other powerful insiders. The theory has been verified in a prototype superscalar processor design that fully implements the OpenRISC processor standard, adapted for encrypted running. The processor runs in a (one-to-many) encryption in user mode, and runs unencrypted in operator mode. The AES-based models run at 104 Dhrystones MIPS on a 1GHz base clock, equivalent to a 433MHz classic Pentium. Experience lets us propose a modified RISC instruction set for encrypted working with which semantic security (relative to the security of the encryption) for user data against the operator is mathematically provable on this kind of platform, in conjunction with an 'obfuscating' compiler for user programs, though the operator has unrestricted runtime access to (encrypted) user data.</details>

**_Fair and Transparent Blockchain Based Tendering Framework - A Step Towards Open Governance_**  
Hardwick, F. S.; Akram, R. N.; Markantonakis, K.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>At a time when society is in constant transition to keep up with technological advancement, we are seeing traditional paradigms being increasingly challenged. The fundamentals of governance are one such paradigm. As society's values have shifted, so have expectations of government shifted from the traditional model to something commonly referred to as `open governance'. Though a disputed term, we take open governance to mean a concept, which encourages and facilitates openness, accountability, and responsiveness to citizens. For the success of open governance initiatives, there are some technologies, such as the internet, that are crucial. These technologies enable access to both the data and to engagement activities between citizens and government. There are also other technologies, like blockchain and smart contacts, which could be utilised to assist open governance. A sound starting point would be moving from a system where information is tediously released by a government, on an `as they please' basis, to an infrastructure where critical actions are captured with strong integrity, non-repudiation and evidential guarantees. With an added dimension that facilitates these actions record be accessible to public scrutiny in near real-time. One candidate technology for capturing such actions is blockchain. Initially, blockchains were mainly used to facilitate cryptocurrencies as a record of transactions. The notable example being bitcoin. However, in recent years, blockchains utility is being recognised through smart contracts - potentially a vital building block to realising open and transparent government activities. In this paper, we employ the concept of smart contracts to government tendering activities. The proposed scheme is based on smart contracts, enabling a fair, transparent and independently verifiable (auditable) government tendering scheme. The scheme is then implemented on the Ethereum platform to evaluate the performance and financial cost implications, along with an evaluation of the potential security and auditability challenges.</details>

**_A Privacy-Preserving Principal Component Analysis Outsourcing Framework_**  
Liu, X.; Lin, Y.; Liu, Q.; Yao, X.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In order to sense and analyze potential information from huge digital data, data mining outsourcing schemes as a principle and effective techniques have recently attracted attention. In this paper, we attempt to guarantee the data privacy of a light-weighted data mining method, Principal Component Analysis (PCA). To achieve our goal, we propose a privacy-preserving PCA(PP-PCA) outsourcing framework, which can understand underlying information without simultaneously disclosing the concrete contents of the data, either the training/predicting data or the prediction results. In our framework, we introduce the Asymmetric Orthogonal Random Linear(AorL) transformation to perturb the training data, utilized by the training model. To protect the privacy of the predicting data and the prediction results, we propose a novel similar-Homomorphic(s-H) preserving technique based on homomorphism encryption mechanism to encrypt the transformed data. Furthermore, our framework is effective and scalable, which allows data users to utilize the trained model from data owner in cloud provider to predict their result. Detailed theoretical analysis and extensive experiments based on three real datasets confirm the security and high efficiency of our framework, respectively.</details>

**_Detecting Domain Generation Algorithms with Convolutional Neural Language Models_**  
Huang, J.; Wang, P.; Zang, T.; Qiang, Q.; Wang, Y.; Yu, M.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>To evade detection, botnets apply DNS domain fluxing for Command and Control (C&C) servers. In this way, each bot generates a large number of domain names with Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) and the botmaster registers only one of them as the domain name of the C&C server. In this paper, we propose Helios, a DGA detection approach based on a neural language model, which exploits the word-formation of domain names to identify domain names generated by DGAs. The key insight of Helios lies in that domain names are composed of syllables or acronyms for easy readability and n-grams can represent both of them. In Helios, we first collect common n-grams in real domain names into a dictionary, then tokenize a domain name into n-grams based on the dictionary, and finally classify the domain name as real or DGA-generated according to the tokenized result. We evaluate Helios with regard to its ability to detect domain names generated by known DGAs and discover new DGA families. Our experimental results show that Helios is able to accurately identify domain names generated by DGAs with a precision of 96.7% and a recall of 95.2%. We also compare Helios with the state-of-the-art detection approach and find that our approach performs more effectively.</details>

**_FPPB: A Fast and Privacy-Preserving Method Based on the Permissioned Blockchain for Fair Transactions in Sharing Economy_**  
Li, B.; Wang, Y.; Shi, P.; Chen, H.; Cheng, L.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Blockchain is a distributed system with efficient transaction recording and has been widely adopted in sharing economy. Although many existing privacy-preserving methods on the blockchain have been proposed, finding a trade-off between keeping speed and preserving privacy of transactions remain challenging. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Fast and Privacy-preserving method based on the Permissioned Blockchain (FPPB) for fair transactions in sharing economy. Without breaking the verifying protocol and bringing additional off-blockchain interactive communication, FPPB protects the privacy and fairness of transactions. Additionally, experiments are implemented in EthereumJ (a Java implementation of the Ethereum protocol) to measure the performance of FPPB. Compared with normal transactions without cryptographic primitives, FPPB only slows down transactions slightly.</details>

**_Consumer Centric Data Control, Tracking and Transparency – A Position Paper_**  
Tapsell, J.; Akram, R. N.; Markantonakis, K.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Personal data related to a user's activities, preferences and services, is considered to be a valuable commodity not only for a wide range of technology-oriented companies like Google, Amazon and Apple but also for more traditional companies like travel/transport, banking, entertainment and marketing industry. This has resulted in more targeted and to a great extend personalised services for individuals - in most cases at a minimal financial cost to them. The operational reality upon which a user authorises companies to collect his/her personal data to receive, in return, more personalised/targeted/context-aware services and hassle-free activities (for users) is widely deployed. It becomes evident that the security, integrity and accessibility of the collected data are of paramount importance. These characteristics are becoming more entrenched in the era of Internet-of-Things (IoT), autonomous vehicles and seamless travel. In this position paper, we examine the challenges faced by both users and organisations in dealing with the Personal Identifiable Information (PII). Furthermore, we expand on the implications of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) specifically for the management of the PII. Subsequently, we extend the discussion to future technologies, especially the IoT and integrated transport systems for better customer experience - and their ramification on the data governance and PII management. Finally, we propose a framework that balances user's privacy and data control with an organisation's objective of delivering quality, targeted and efficient services to their customers using the “collected user data”. This framework is referred to as “Consumer Oriented Data Control & Auditability” (CODCA) and defines the technologies that are adapted to privacy concerns and legal/regulation-frameworks.</details>

**_Achieving Secure and Effective Search Services in Cloud Computing_**  
Liu, Q.; Pei, S.; Xie, K.; Wu, J.; Peng, T.; Wang, G.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>One critical challenge of today's cloud services is how to provide an effective search service while preserving user privacy. In this paper, we propose a wildcard-based multi-keyword fuzzy search (WMFS) scheme over the encrypted data, which tolerates keyword misspellings by exploiting the indecomposable property of primes. Compared with existing secure fuzzy search schemes, our WMFS scheme has the following merits: 1) Efficiency. It eliminates the requirement of a predefined dictionary and thus supports updates efficiently. 2) High accuracy. It eliminates the false positive and false negative introduced by specific data structures and thus allows the user to retrieve files as accurate as possible. 3) Flexibility. It gives the user great flexibility to specify different search patterns including keyword and substring matching. Extensive experiments on a real data set demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our scheme.</details>

**_Node Immunization in Networks with Uncertainty_**  
Ren, Y.; Jiang, M.; Yao, Y.; Wu, T.; Wang, Z.; Li, M.; Choo, K. R.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In immunization strategy, the general focus is to identify and prevent malicious attacks or malware spreading from one node to its neighboring nodes in static networks. However, in many different real-world applications, the transmission routes are uncertain or unstable. The number of uncertain edges determines the number of networks that can be produced, which are referred to as sample networks. Large number of sample networks will significantly increase the computational complexity in the network with uncertainty. In this paper, we first propose a measure to assess the spread of disease or virus in networks with uncertainty (e.g. in a technical network, connections between nodes may fail due to the unstable signal). Specifically, we introduce the concepts of excepted eigenvalue (EE) and excepted fraction of infected node (EF) to quantify the spread strength and influence of disease or viruses. The aim is to minimize the EE and EF values of the remaining network after immunizing with k nodes. Therefore, we design an algorithm based on the characteristics of degree and largest eigenvalue in uncertain networks. We also select an appropriate number of sample networks to reduce the computational cost and guarantee high accuracy level. Findings from the simulations on synthetic and real networks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</details>

**_Effective Mobile Web User Fingerprinting via Motion Sensors_**  
Yang, Z.; Zhao, R.; Yue, C.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Motion sensors are often equipped on smartphones to enable rich app functionality and interactivity. However, they can also be exploited by attackers as powerful side-channels to compromise users' security and privacy due to the unrestricted sensor data access on modern smartphone platforms. In this paper, we investigate motion sensor based user fingerprinting attacks that can be pervasively performed to severely compromise the privacy of mobile web users. We formulate our user fingerprinting attacks as a typical multi-class classification problem, and design a framework with unified classifiers for effectively performing the attacks. We implement our attacking framework and evaluate it using the motion sensor data collected from 20 volunteers. The evaluation results demonstrate that our attacks are indeed very effective. For example, the user fingerprinting accuracy is higher than 85% by using a classifier unified from seven randomly selected individual classifiers each trained with the motion sensor data of only 10 letter keystrokes.</details>

**_Qualified eID Derivation Into a Distributed Ledger Based IdM System_**  
Abraham, A.; Theuermann, K.; Kirchengast, E.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Traditional identity management systems (IdMS) suffer from significant weaknesses, such as the reliance on a single central entity that provides the identity data or the users lack control over their identity data. The introduction of qualified self-sovereign identities (SSIs) for eGovernment systems can strengthen the privacy of citizens. Furthermore, it is possible to solve fundamental trust issues of traditional IdMS by utilizing distributed ledger technology (DLT) together with performing a consensus algorithm. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, this paper proposes a solution for the derivation of qualified electronic identities (eIDs), issued by a traditional IdMS, into a distributed ledger (DL) based IdMS that enables SSIs. Second, we have implemented a proof-of-concept (PoC) realizing qualified eID derivation into an SSI system based on the DLT. This PoC was realized, among others, by introducing an agent that represents the interface between the traditional IdM and the SSI system as well as by extending the consensus algorithm. The proposed approach used for eID derivation ensures the maintenance of the trust as well as the quality of the identity data.</details>

**_A Hybrid Recommendation Algorithm Based on Heuristic Similarity and Trust Measure_**  
Yang, C.; Chen, X.; Song, T.; Jiang, B.; Liu, Q.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this paper, we propose a hybrid collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on heuristic similarity and trust measure, in order to alleviate the problem of data sparsity, cold start and trust measure. Firstly, a new similarity measure is implemented by weighted fusion of multiple similarity influence factors obtained from the rating matrix, so that the similarity measure becomes more accurate. Then, a user trust relationship computing model is implemented by constructing the user's trust network based on the trust propagation theory. On this basis, a SIMT collaborative filtering algorithm is designed which integrates trust and similarity instead of the similarity in traditional collaborative filtering algorithm. Further, an improved K nearest neighbor recommendation based on clustering algorithm is implemented for generation of a better recommendation list. Finally, a comparative experiment on FilmTrust dataset shows that the proposed algorithm has improved the quality and accuracy of recommendation, thus overcome the problem of data sparsity, cold start and trust measure to a certain extent.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>With RDF knowledge base and SPARQL have been widely used, the performance of query engine gets more attention. In the actual complicated application scenarios, query engine may receive intensive query requests with similar structure in a short time, as usual these queries will be evaluated independently. Multi-query optimization evaluation approach can mine feasible common query patterns deeply, choose preferable combination of common query patterns according to the cost model, and reduce the total time consumption by taking advantage of the common query pattern evaluation results. The experiments on LUBM dataset indicate that the total evaluation time of multi-query optimization evaluation approach is shorter than sequential evaluation approach and making the throughput of query engine improve.</details>

**_Identifying WeChat Red Packets and Fund Transfers Via Analyzing Encrypted Network Traffic_**  
Yan, F.; Xu, M.; Qiao, T.; Wu, T.; Yang, X.; Zheng, N.; Choo, K. R.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>WeChat is an extremely popular application in China and among the overseas Chinese users, and two widely used features are giving of 'red packet' (a Chinese customary practice of giving money in red envelope) or fund transfer. Investigation of WeChat red packet and fund transfer transactions is an understudied topic, and hence the focus of this paper. Specifically, we analyze the encrypted network traffic involving WeChat red packet and fund transfer transactions. We segment the traffic into several bursts describing the different actions. Then, we extract relevant red packet transaction and fund transfer features from each burst, which are then used to train a learning-based classifier to distinguish between the different bursts. The findings from our evaluation demonstrate that our proposed approach can accurately identify the actions of red packet transactions and fund transfers, as well as accurately predicting the number of red packet transactions and fund transfers.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Dating applications (apps) are becoming more niche and intimate, allowing users interested in alternative sexual lifestyles to discover each other in relation to their geo-location as well as mutual sexual interests. Such apps can provide a wealth of information in a forensic investigation, although research in this topic appears limited. This paper examines the extent and type of artifacts created on a device when using Feeld, an app whose user base is unconventional either by their sexual identity or by an inclination to experience alternative sexual activities, and their impact on the privacy of users sharing the most personal details of their sexual lives. Such users may be at a higher risk of victimization due to their sexual identity or orientation. Specifically, we demonstrate what types of data can be forensically recovered (e.g. messages to and from user account, and photos belonging to other dating app users), and how distance information stored by the app can be used to conduct a trilateration attack and successfully expose another user's actual location.</details>

**_A Co-training Based Hardware Trojan Detection Technique by Exploiting Unlabeled ICs and Inaccurate Simulation Models_**  
Xue, M.; Bian, R.; Wang, J.; Liu, W.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Integrated circuits (ICs) are becoming vulnerable to hardware Trojans. Most of existing works require golden chips to provide references for hardware Trojan detection. However, a golden chip is extremely difficult to obtain. In previous work, we have proposed a classification-based golden chips-free hardware Trojan detection technique. However, the algorithm in the previous work are trained by simulated ICs without considering that there may be a shift which occurs between the simulation and the silicon fabrication. It is necessary to learn from actual silicon fabrication in order to obtain an accurate and effective classification model. We propose a co-training based hardware Trojan detection technique exploiting unlabeled fabricated ICs and inaccurate simulation models, to provide reliable detection capability when facing fabricated ICs, while eliminating the need of fabricated golden chips. First, we train two classification algorithms using simulated ICs. During test-time, the two algorithms can identify different patterns in the unlabeled ICs, and thus be able to label some of these ICs for the further training of the another algorithm. Moreover, we use a statistical examination to choose ICs labeling for the another algorithm in order to help prevent a degradation in performance due to the increased noise in the labeled ICs. We also use a statistical technique for combining the hypotheses from the two classification algorithms to obtain the final decision. The theoretical basis of why the co-training method can work is also described. Experiment results on benchmark circuits show that the proposed technique can detect unknown Trojans with high accuracy (92% 97%) and recall (88% 95%).</details>

**_Building Trusted Golden Models-Free Hardware Trojan Detection Framework Against Untrustworthy Testing Parties Using a Novel Clustering Ensemble Technique_**  
Bian, R.; Xue, M.; Wang, J.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>As a result of the globalization of integrated circuits (ICs) design and fabrication process, ICs are becoming vulnerable to hardware Trojans. Most of the existing hardware Trojan detection works suppose that the testing stage is trustworthy. However, testing parties may conspire with malicious attackers to modify the results of hardware Trojan detection. In this paper, we propose a trusted and robust hardware Trojan detection framework against untrustworthy testing parties exploiting a novel clustering ensemble method. The proposed technique can expose the malicious modifications on Trojan detection results introduced by untrustworthy testing parties. Compared with the state-of-the-art detection methods, the proposed technique does not require fabricated golden chips or simulated golden models. The experiment results on ISCAS89 benchmark circuits show that the proposed technique can resist modifications robustly and detect hardware Trojans with decent accuracy (up to 91%).</details>

**_A Compact, Lightweight and Low-Cost 8-Bit Datapath AES Circuit for IoT Applications in 28nm CMOS_**  
Lu, M.; Fan, A.; Xu, J.; Shan, W.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Lightweight AES encryption circuits are significant to IoT applications to protect data, where very strict area and power constraints are required. In this paper, we propose a novel 8-bit datapath AES architecture aiming for a small area and a high energy efficiency. Firstly, our proposed design reduces the number of temporary data storage (IntermediateReg) to 40-bit from the originally 128-bit, which saves 68.75% intermediate registers. Secondly, only one S-Box is implemented in the design that is reused throughout the whole AES operations to achieve a low area. Thirdly, the architecture is further optimized to reduce the number of clock cycles by reusing S-Box in the key expansion and the data encryption module, leading to only 213 total cycles of latency in a complete encryption process. Simulation results under TSMC 28nm technology show that our proposed AES circuit consumes an area of 0.0028mm2, with an energy efficiency of 667Gbps/W (equivalent to 1.50 pJ/bit) and throughput rate of 30.05Mbps at 0.5V. This design achieves a high energy efficiency per unit area of 0.278 Gbps/(W·um2). This small area, high energy efficiency and relatively high throughput AES circuit is suitable for IoT applications.</details>

**_Differential Power Analysis of 8-Bit Datapath AES for IoT Applications_**  
Xu, J.; Fan, A.; Lu, M.; Shan, W.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The security issue of Internet of Things (IoT) applications causes wide concern nowadays. Lightweight encryption circuits are preferred in IoT due to its severe restrictions of chip area and power consumption, among which, 8-bit datapath Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is popular for its mature algorithm, compact architecture and low power consumption. However, it is also subject to the side channel analysis (SCA) attack, which is rarely mentioned. In this paper, a novel differential power analysis (DPA) attack method specialized for 8-bit datapath AES is proposed, which exploits the correlation between the power consumption of S-Box and processed data. The method can traverse all the possibilities. As a result, it is effective for almost all the existing 8-bit AES architecture in theory. The first round of encryption is adopted as the target round, avoiding the complicated computing in AES algorithm to reduce the cost of attack and increase the success rate and efficiency. The effectivity of this kind of method is verified by FPGA implementation on SAKURA-G board, with a minimum of 3681 power traces to crack the correct sub-key.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Side-channel Attack, such as simple power analysis and differential power analysis (DPA), is an efficient method to gather the key, which challenges the security of crypto chips. Side-channel Attack logs the power trace of the crypto chip and speculate the key by statistical analysis. To reduce the threat of power analysis attack, an innovative method based on random execution is proposed in this paper. In order to enhance ability against DPA, the method disorders the correspondence between power trace and operands by scrambling the data execution sequence randomly and dynamically. Experiments and verification are done on the Sakura-G FPGA platform. The results show that the key is not reveal after even 1 million power traces by adopting proposed method and only 1.12% slices overhead is introduced. Compared to unprotected chip, it increases more than 140× measure to disclosure.</details>

**_RNS-Based Embedding Scheme for Data Hiding in Digital Images_**  
Yao, Y.; Zhou, J.; Yan, B.; Li, Y.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this paper, a residue number system (RNS)-based data embedding scheme is proposed, which converts secret information and image cover into residues. Since the residues represent the lowest levels of a continuous-tone image that human eyes are not sensitive to, the residues of cover can be considered as redundancy, which are replaced by the embedded residual data without introducing perceptible distortions. In addition, it provides additional security with a set of modulus. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed technique achieves higher imperceptibility and payload than other state-of-the-art techniques. Especially, when compared with the least significant bit (LSB) embedding technology, the cost of cover is reduced by 90.62% and the imperceptibility is increased by 4.87dB. Furthermore, in case of damage, the proposed method has a potential capability of lossless data recovery by the dynamic range adjustment technique.</details>

**_Partial Scan Design Against Scan-Based Side Channel Attacks_**  
Chen, X.; Lu, Z.; Qu, G.; Cui, A.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Testing is essential to isolate good chips from faulty ones. Scan chain, which provides test engineer access to all the flip flops in the chip, is the backbone of industrial testing methods. However, attackers can also leverage the controllability and observability of scan chain as a side channel to break systems such as cryptographic chips. In this paper, we develop a partial scan chain based approach to prevent side channel attacks. The basic idea is to remove the flip flops that store sensitive information from the full scan chain. However, the challenge is how to keep the full test coverage as we demonstrate that using industrial design tools such as traditional partial scan not only fails to provide full fault coverage, but also incurs huge overhead in test time and test vector generation time. We use a novel finite state machine (FSM) structure to deliver secure controllability of the un-chained flip flops to test engineers while using lightweight LFSR and XOR to enable the observability. We conduct experiments to demonstrate that the proposed partial scan, comparing to the full scan, gives full test coverage with reduced test time and does not need to re-generate test vectors.</details>

**_Towards Trustworthy Information Sharing by Creating Cyber Security Alliances_**  
Deljoo, A.; Engers, T. van; Koning, R.; Gommans, L.; Laat, C. de
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>As attacks are becoming more and more organized, collaboration amongst network domain owners is required next to arranging technical counter measures. Sharing cyber intelligence amongst network domain owners is, therefore, becoming increasingly important. Additionally, networks have grown scale, complexity, and degree of inter-connectedness, such that their protection can often only be guaranteed and financed as a shared effort. In this paper, we introduce the concept of cyber security alliance shaped by different organizations that facilitate the sharing of incident information across them. Creating a cyber security alliance highlights requirements such as: 1) creates and manages trust among the members, 2) introduces a federated governance model, creating common policies, standards for alliance's members, and 3) provides a strong incentive to partners to join an alliance by introducing a common benefit. This paper discusses ongoing research on a social trust model, which helps the members to select the right partner to perform joint tasks, and encourages sharing of incident information. Furthermore, we use the service provider group framework as a way to arrange the establishment of our proposed cyber security alliance that coordinates activities across the alliance to establish trust. We present our social computational trust model and its antecedents.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>With the widespread use of VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal, proposed by Hughes Company) network solution, some aspects of VSAT network, such as the transparent transmission and the openness, need to be improved to counter security threats. This paper proposes a new authentication scheme named lite-CA (Lite Certification Authority) to reduce the number of simultaneous interaction within the framework of VSAT network. In order to achieve a high real-time data transmission encryption, a new encryption algorithm-HW-F (high weight function) is used to replace the traditional public key encryption system and symmetric encryption system. By analyzing the VSAT network, VSAT network is simulated based on the SDK (Software Development Kit) and UGIS (Urban Geographic Information System) to realize data encryption and access authentication. The test result shown in this paper illustrates that this new authentication can be a method of allowing for communication reliability of VSAT.</details>

We aim to we supervise temperature and pressure to be able to predict and estimate any possible disaster.

Moreover, we propose to measure variation of temperature, pressure and vibration using sensors based on optical Brillouin backscattering. Indeed, we highlight the difference between two type of Brillouin sensors: the first one is Brillouin Optical Time division Reflectometers (BOTDR) and the second is Brillouin Optical Time division Analysis (BOTDA). Likewise, we report a novel use of Brillouin sensors on the simultaneous monitoring of temperature and pressure variation in early disaster detection.</details>

**_An Implementation of Hierarchical Intrusion Detection Systems Using Snort and Federated Databases_**  
Kang, S. k; Lindskog, D.; Samuel, H.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>This research presents a pragmatic implementation of a hierarchical distributed intrusion detection system. Several hierarchical distributed intrusion detection architectures have been proposed for use in various network topologies. However, to our knowledge, practical implementations of these solutions have not been explored. This study proposes to implement such an architecture using a combination of Snort and MySQL databases. Intrusion Detection Systems may act as defensive mechanisms, since they monitor network activities in order to detect malicious actions performed by intruders, and then initiate the appropriate countermeasures. This research work also shows the root node is at the top of the IDS hierarchy and receives aggregated/consolidated intrusion detection information from the entire network by using federated databases. Intrusion detection occurs at the cluster head of each cluster by gathering data from cluster members to have faster detection. Ultimately, this is an initial step towards evaluation of hierarchical intrusion detection approaches.</details>

Yang, C.; Li, X.; Yin, S.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Power-Aware Hiding (PAH) has been proposed as a kind of energy-efficient Side Channel Attacks (SCA) countermeasure for S-boxes. However, it has large area overhead. In this paper, an improved SCA-resistant AES S-box implementation, which is based on PAH technique but has smaller area, is proposed. It implements the S-Box in the masked composited field approach but applies the PAH method to the inversion in GF(24). Evaluation result shows that its area is shrunken to 47.7% of the full PAH S-box, and that its power-delay product is about 81% lower than that of the traditional masking implementation. Simulation shows that the PAH inverter's power difference is smaller than the other candidates, including the PAH S-box. It is secure under moment-correlating power analysis with 70,000 noiseless power traces at least.</details>

**_A Novel Identity Authentication for FPGA Based IP Designs_**  
Huang, Y.; Liang, W.; Long, J.; Xu, J.; Li, K.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>With the rapid development of Internet-of-Things (IoT), hardware security becomes an important issue. Once a chip is attacked, the authentication always faces serious credibility crisis. In this work, a Hausdorff distance model-based scheme is proposed to authenticate circuit identity under IoT environment. Firstly, the structure of FPGA is analyzed and the positions of LUTs are abstracted into a collection of reconfigurable nodes. The depth-first searching algorithm is used to determine the unused LUT resources for inserting the copyright information. The Hausdorff distance matching function is utilized to reorder the random positions. These positions will be further mapped to satisfy specific constraints of the optimal watermark positions. As the identity of circuit requires real-time authentication, virtual positions are mapped to initial key file. Once decrypted, the identity can be authenticated by the mapping relationship of Hausdorff distance function. Lastly, we conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the ability of the proposed scheme against illegal attacks, such as removal attacks. Experiments show that, the proposed scheme has good randomness and secrecy. Besides, the resource overhead during authentication is encouraging.</details>

**_Detection and Prevention of Routing Attacks in Internet of Things_**  
Choudhary, S.; Kesswani, N.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Internet of things (IoT) is the smart network which connects smart objects over the Internet. The Internet is untrusted and unreliable network and thus IoT network is vulnerable to different kind of attacks. Conventional encryption and authentication techniques sometimes fail on IoT based network and intrusion may succeed to destroy the network. So, it is necessary to design intrusion detection system for such network. In our paper, we detect routing attacks such as sinkhole and selective forwarding. We have also tried to prevent our network from these attacks. We designed detection and prevention algorithm, i.e., KMA (Key Match Algorithm) and CBA (Cluster- Based Algorithm) in MatLab simulation environment. We gave two intrusion detection mechanisms and compared their results as well. True positive intrusion detection rate for our work is between 50% to 80% with KMA and 76% to 96% with CBA algorithm.</details>

Sajjad, S. M.; Yousaf, M.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Botnets are being used for launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks causing massive financial loses to the enterprises. With the rise of low-cost, less protected Internet of Things (IoT) devices the likelihood of harm from botnets have also increased. Open sourcing the source code of Mirai IoT malware has provided the foundation step for the development and subsequent launch of variants of Mirai IoT botnets. Detecting such kind of threats is essential for the smooth operation of the Internet. Such security measures are basic requirements for the establishment of user trust on the Internet of Things devices. This paper presents UCAM: Usage, Communication and Access Monitoring Based Botnets Detection System for IoT. The proposed solution has three main components i.e. descriptor, monitor and comparator. Descriptor defines Device Usage, Communication and Access policies. Monitor observes the current state of device Usage, Communication and Access. Anomalies are Detected by the Comparator. Results show that the proposed detection system successfully detects Mirai IoT malware.</details>

**_Proposal of Multi-channel Operation Technique Using PingPong256_**  
Kim, K.; Lee, H.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The stream cipher is a cipher system that takes a random number in bits and takes an exclusive OR with the plaintext. PingPong256 generates a bit-wise random number using an LFSR having two different lengths in an encryption method corresponding to a stream cipher. The LFSR can generate various types of patterns by generating the maximum period according to the length. It is possible to generate a random number of a long cycle by changing it to operate irregularly by utilizing a variable clock structure. In addition to the encryption technique, the random number generator compares the generation of the authentication key based on mutual initial values, and can be used for mutual authentication. It is also possible to use it for synchronization according to a separate hardware. In this paper, we examined the basic structure of PingPong256 and the result of random number generation.</details>

**_A Reversible Data Hiding Scheme with High Security and Improved Embedding Capacity_**  
Yadav, G. S.; Ojha, A.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Security and privacy of secret information in communication has always been a prime concern. Numerous methods have been proposed for data hiding in images. Reversible data hiding schemes have gained popularity for their potential applications in a number of fields. Such schemes however have limited data embedding capacity as compared to LSB based data hiding schemes. This paper aims at providing a secure reversible data hiding scheme with improved payload and good image quality. The scheme uses a Hilbert curve to generate data embedding patterns and a logistic map to encrypt the stego image for improving the security. Key sensitivity analysis shows that the scheme is robust to any brute force attack. A framework is presented for application of the proposed scheme to biometric based remote authentication.</details>

**_Behavioral-Based Classification and Identification of Ransomware Variants Using Machine Learning_**  
Daku, H.; Zavarsky, P.; Malik, Y.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Due to the changing behavior of ransomware, traditional classification and detection techniques do not accurately detect new variants of ransomware. Attackers use polymorphic and metamorphic techniques to avoid detection of signature-based systems. We use machine learning classification to identify modified variants of ransomware based on their behavior. To conduct our study, we used behavioral reports of 150 ransomware samples from 10 different ransomware families. Our data-set includes some of the newest ransomware samples available, providing an evaluation of the classification accuracy of machine learning algorithms on the current evolving status of ransomware. An iterative approach is used to identify optimum behavioral attributes used to achieve best classification accuracy. Two main parts of this study are identification of the behavioral attributes which can be used for optimal classification accuracy and classification of ransomware using machine learning algorithms. We have evaluated classification accuracy of three machine learning classification algorithms.</details>

**_ALDD: A Hybrid Traffic-User Behavior Detection Method for Application Layer DDoS_**  
Jiang, J.; Yu, Q.; Yu, M.; Li, G.; Chen, J.; Liu, K.; Liu, C.; Huang, W.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) has been one of the most critical threats to internet applications and web services. Especially with the current advances in network technology, many attackers resort to application layer DDoS (ALDDoS) which utilizes legitimate requests to overwhelm the victim servers. Under this kind of attack, the single request content can be highly similar to normal ones, and this renders previous traffic features-based detection methods void. In this paper, we are addressing two common issues in ALDDoS detection methods: the inaccuracy of traffic feature based detecting algorithms, and the time and space complexity of user behavior-based detecting algorithms. Different from the existing detection pattern for each request, the detection pattern used in this paper is for a time window. We extract instances of traffic and user behaviors from web server logs, and propose a hybrid traffic-user behavior detection method for ALDDoS. Neutral network is adopted for further cluster analysis. Experimental results on the recent public dataset CICIDS2017 indicate that the proposed method can achieve high detection accuracy while reducing 90% of time cost.</details>

**_Migrating Data Between Physical Server and Cloud: Improving Accuracy and Data Integrity_**  
Alkhonaini, M.; El-Sayed, H.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The Cloud (Cloud Computing) has been the center of attraction for both businesses and organizations. As the organizations make the ultimate decision of embracing the technology and moving their services and data to the Cloud, a greater danger of losing the data in the process of migrating from the traditionally physical computing to Cloud computing is something that cannot be overlooked. In this paper, we propose a system that detects and eliminates data loss, incomplete transfer or modification of data during the migration process from the traditionally physical computing to cloud computing. This system will ensure that the migrated data in the cloud server is an exact replica of the data in the physical server from which the data is being migrated from. This will be achieved by a combination of algorithms that will segment, encrypt and compare the migrated data with the original data beside 3-way handshake signaling protocol that has never been effectively implemented in the cloud computing migration environment.</details>

**_OAuth-SSO: A Framework to Secure the OAuth-Based SSO Service for Packaged Web Applications_**  
Hossain, N.; Hossain, M. A.; Hossain, M. Z.; Sohag, M. H. I.; Rahman, S.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The OAuth 2.0 is an authorization protocol gives authorization on the Web. Popular social networks like Facebook, Google and Twitter make their APIs based on the OAuth protocol to increase user experience of SSO and social sharing. It is an open standard for authorization and gives a process for third-party applications to obtain users' resources on the resource servers without sharing their login credentials. Single sign-on (SSO) is an identification method that makes allowance for websites to use other, rely on sites to confirm users. OAuth 2.0 is broadly used in Single Sign-On (SSO) service because of its simple implementation and coherence with a diversity of the third-party applications. It has been proved secure in different formal methods, but some vulnerabilities are revealed in practice. In this paper, we mention a general approach to improve the security of OAuth based SSO service for packaged web app. This paper proposes a modified method to execute OAuth flow from such applications with the help of Single sign-on (SSO) manages the life cycle of these applications.</details>

**_Energy Efficiency Analysis of Elliptic Curve Based Cryptosystems_**  
Banerjee, T.; Hasan, M. A.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Energy consumption is an important factor for any cryptoscheme, implemented on devices having limited energy resource. In this paper, we analyze the energy consumption during the Diffie-Hellman key exchange implemented on both supersingular and ordinary elliptic curves. The former protocol is Supersingular Isogeny based Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) and the latter is Elliptic Curve based Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) respectively. Implementations are executed on 64 bit Intel Skylake processor. The energy consumption is analysed for the classical bit security levels of 128 and 192. In this paper, a detailed comparison of power and energy consumption by elliptic curve point addition and doubling operations is presented for affine and standard projective coordinates. Projective coordinates based elliptic curve operations are found to be around 50 to 60 times more energy efficient. We then analyze SIDH and ECDH, implemented using projective coordinates. Our results show that, SIDH consumes around 37 to 47 times more energy in comparison to ECDH for the above mentioned bit security levels.</details>

**_Research on Information Security Perception of Sina Weibo Users Based on KISCAP Model_**  
Tse, D.; Weng, X.; Wan, X.; Yao, L.; Zhang, W.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Social network service (SNS) has experienced a dramatical growth in the whole world including China. The representative of which in China are Sina Weibo and Tencent Wechat. People prefer to share their information on Sina Weibo. During the use, people will encounter various kinds of security issues, such as personal information leakage. Not only because of technological development but also due to users' unsafe usage patterns, users' accounts may be stolen by some criminals who will use victim's accounts for deception. Therefore, an increasing number of people begin to pay much attention to information security in Sina Weibo. This study mainly focuses on exploring the potential relationship between users' perception of information security and their common usages and behaviors in Sina Weibo. In terms of KISCAP model, we divide users' perception of information security into five primary factors, perceived knowledge, perceived controllability, perceived awareness, perceived severity and perceived possibility, which are assumed to be correlated to usage willingness and security action adoption. The experimental results verify our hypothesis that perceived information security has a positive impact on security action adoption and usage willingness in Sina Weibo. Besides, some practical implementation issues for both users and Sina Weibo are recommended accordingly.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>This study evaluates the current series of events relating that information and data security and familiarity with our practices have not helped in securing our systems as predicted. Though we have made progress recently, lots of security breaches to data still occur that seem preventable. The past incidents do not seem to prepare us to respond to the next adequately. This study suggests the prospective reasons for the challenges involved in creating a Risk Management Plan (RMP), examines the importance of the plan as well as the factors responsible for their successes in government agencies. Many organizations often relegate to the background, the need for risk management plans although it is one of the most important success factors in organizational development. Creating a risk management policy in the government requires special skill because all the stakeholders will be involved to direct and approve the final draft. The Risk Management Plan is the working document of the organization that details how the organization intends to develop, test, remediate and implement risk management plans within the organization.</details>

**_Hierarchical Polynomial-Based Key Management Scheme in Fog Computing_**  
Albakri, A.; Maddumala, M.; Harn, L.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Accretion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices connected to the cloud has created several performance issues such as high latency and network congestion. To overcome these issues, fog computing has been deployed at the edge of the network between the cloud and the user network. Although fog comes with promising solutions to overcome the performance issues in the cloud, security and privacy issues need further attention. Designing security protocols in resource-limited user devices (i.e. IoT) is a challenging task. We propose a lightweight hierarchical key management with a deterministic scheme that guarantees a shared key between a fog node and a user device. Furthermore, it is a scalable scheme in which a new node can be easily added without affecting the security of the network. Moreover, the security can be enhanced without increasing the storage requirements of user devices.</details>

**_Who Would you Like to be Today?: Impersonation by Fake Azure Active Directory Identity Federation_**  
Syynimaa, N.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Azure Active Directory (AAD) is Microsoft's cloud-based directory and identity management service used by various service providers (SPs). For instance, Microsoft's own Office 365 is utilizing identity management services of AAD. Hundreds of external SPs are also providing services which are supporting AAD identities. Besides cloud-based managed identities, AAD also supports federated identities where authentication is performed by the external identity provider (IdP). Identity federation is based on a trust between SP and IdP. In this paper, we will report a vulnerability in AAD identity federation which enables undetectable identity impersonation. The vulnerability is caused by a design flaw in the trust to IdPs. We will also introduce some methods to detect the exploitation of the vulnerability and provide advice how to limit the risk of exploitation.</details>

**_On the Incremental Digital Signatures_**  
Atighehchi, K.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The purpose of incremental cryptography is to enable updates of cryptographic forms of documents undergoing modifications, more efficiently than if we had to recompute them from scratch. This paper defines a framework for securely using a variant of the incremental hash function designed by Goi, Siddiqi and Chuah. The condition of use of their hash function is somehow impractical since they assume the blocks of the message are all distinct. In this paper we show how we can discard this strong assumption so as to construct the first practical incremental asymmetric signature scheme that keeps efficient update operations. Finally, as the proposed scheme has the defect to severely expand the signature size, we propose a solution which drastically reduces this drawback.</details>

**_Optimized Data de-Identification Using Multidimensional k-Anonymity_**  
Liu, K.; Kuo, C.; Liao, W.; Wang, P.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In the globalized knowledge economy, big data analytics have been widely applied in diverse areas. A critical issue in big data analysis on personal information is the possible leak of personal privacy. Therefore, it is necessary to have an anonymization-based de-identification method to avoid undesirable privacy leak. Such method can prevent published data form being traced back to personal privacy. Prior empirical researches have provided approaches to reduce privacy leak risk, e.g. Maximum Distance to Average Vector (MDAV), Condensation Approach and Differential Privacy. However, previous methods inevitably generate synthetic data of different sizes and is thus unsuitable for general use. To satisfy the need of general use, k-anonymity can be chosen as a privacy protection mechanism in the de-identification process to ensure the data not to be distorted, because k-anonymity is strong in both protecting privacy and preserving data authenticity. Accordingly, this study proposes an optimized multidimensional method for anonymizing data based on both the priority weight-adjusted method and the mean difference recommending tree method (MDR tree method). The results of this study reveal that this new method generate more reliable anonymous data and reduce the information loss rate.</details>

**_Quantifying Information Exposure in Internet Routing_**  
Mell, P.; Gueye, A.; Schanzle, C.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Data sent over the Internet can be monitored and manipulated by intermediate entities in the data path from the source to the destination. For unencrypted communications (and some encrypted communications with known weaknesses), eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks are possible. For encrypted communication, the identification of the communicating endpoints is still revealed. In addition, encrypted communications may be stored until such time as newly discovered weaknesses in the encryption algorithm or advances in computer hardware render them readable by attackers. In this work, we use public data to evaluate both advertised and observed routes through the Internet and measure the extent to which communications between pairs of countries are exposed to other countries. We use both physical router geolocation as well as the country of registration of the companies owning each router. We find a high level of information exposure; even physically adjacent countries use routes that involve many other countries. We also found that countries that are well 'connected' tend to be more exposed. Our analysis indicates that there exists a tradeoff between robustness and information exposure in the current Internet.</details>

**_Malicious Entities are in Vain: Preserving Privacy in Publish and Subscribe Systems_**  
Cui, S.; Belguith, S.; Alwis, P. De; Asghar, M. R.; Russello, G.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Publish and subscribe (pub/sub) system is a decoupled communication paradigm that allows routing of publications. Through a set of dedicated third party servers, referred to as brokers, publications are disseminated without establishing any link between publishers and subscribers. However, the involvement of these brokers raises security and privacy issues as they can harvest sensitive data about subscribers. Furthermore, a malicious broker may collude with malicious subscribers and/or publishers to infer subscribers' interests. Our solution is such that subscribers' interests are not revealed to curious brokers and published data can only be accessed by the authorised subscribers. Moreover, the proposed protocol is secure against the collusion attacks between malicious brokers, publishers, and subscribers.</details>

In this paper, we propose a novel scheme that allows analysts to perform great aggregate analysis while guaranteeing meaningful protection of each individuals privacy. Differential privacy aims to ensure means to maximize the accuracy of queries from statistical databases while minimizing the probabilities of identifying its records. With adding Gaussian noise, we are able to achieve this goal. First, we present an algorithm for private matrix completion. Secondly, we provide theoretical results for required Gaussian noise. Finally, we compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with the state-of-the-art, while both achieves the same level of differential privacy.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Exfiltrating sensitive information from smartphones has become one of the most significant security threats. We have built a system to identify HTTP-based information exfiltration of malicious Android applications. In this paper, we discuss the method to track the propagation of sensitive information in Android applications using static taint analysis. We have studied the leaked information, destinations to which information is exfiltrated, and their correlations with types of sensitive information. The analysis results based on 578 malicious Android applications have revealed that a significant portion of these applications are interested in identity-related sensitive information. The vast majority of malicious applications leak multiple types of sensitive information. We have also identified servers associated with three country codes including CN, US, and SG are most active in collecting sensitive information. The analysis results have also demonstrated that a wide range of non-default ports are used by suspicious URLs.</details>

**_Privacy-Preserving Sensory Data Recovery_**  
Chen, C.; Zhang, M.; Zhang, H.; Huang, Z.; Li, Y.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In recent years, a large scale of various wireless sensor networks have been deployed for basic scientific works. Massive data loss is so common that there is a great demand for data recovery. While data recovery methods fulfil the requirement of accuracy, the potential privacy leakage caused by them concerns us a lot. Thus the major challenge of sensory data recovery is the issue of effective privacy preservation. Existing algorithms can either accomplish accurate data recovery or solve privacy issue, yet no single design is able to address these two problems simultaneously. Therefore in this paper, we propose a novel approachPrivacy-Preserving Compressive Sensing with Multi-Attribute Assistance(PPCS-MAA). It applies PPCS scheme to sensory data recovery, which can effectively encrypts sensory data without decreasing accuracy, because it maintains the homomorphic obfuscation property for compressive sensing. In addition, multiple environmental attributes from sensory datasets usually have strong correlation so that we design aMulti-Attribute Assistance(MAA) component to leverage this feature for better recovery accuracy. Combining PPCS with MAA, the novel recovery scheme can provide reliable privacy with high accuracy. Firstly, based on two real datasets, IntelLab and GreenOrbs, we reveal the inherited low-rank features as the ground truth and find such multi-attribute correlation. Secondly, we develop a PPCS-MAA algorithm. Thirdly, the results of real data-driven simulations show that the algorithm outperforms the existing solutions.</details>

**_Detecting Swimming Pools in 15-Minute Load Data_**  
Burkhart, S.; Unterweger, A.; Eibl, G.; Engel, D.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The ability to detect appliances in load data highly depends on the resolution of the data. While a lot of related work exists on detecting appliances in second or sub-second granularity load data, in this paper, we detect swimming pools through their filter pumps in load data with the 15-minute granularity prescribed by the European Union for smart meters. We model the filter pump based on exemplary measurements and describe a prototypical algorithm to extract the filter pump's consumption from the aggregated mains signal of a real-world household. We evaluate pool detection performance with different classifiers on a data set with 843 households, where the information on the existence of a swimming pool is available. We achieve 94.8% detection accuracy with a precision of 68.5% with an off-the-shelf classifier. Decreasing the temporal resolution in several steps to 8 hours negatively affects the recall while the precision stays at the same level. We find that these results raise privacy concerns even at the minimum temporal resolution of smart meter data that is legally required in the European Union.</details>

**_C2R Net: The Coarse to Refined Network for Image Forgery Detection_**  
Wei, Y.; Bi, X.; Xiao, B.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Image splicing forgery means to extract a portion from one image and then place it to another image for merging a new image. Distinguishing a splicing forgery image is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based method to detect splicing image. The proposed network includes two convolutional neural networks (CNNs): the coarse CNN and the refined CNN, which extracts the differences between image itself and splicing regions from patch descriptors of different scales. Unlike previous detection methods that always rely on one property difference detection between the splicing image and the original image, the proposed detection method learns various intrinsic property differences between the splicing images and the original images by CNNs with different scales. For decreasing the complexity of computational time, we further propose image-level CNN to replace the previous patch-level CNN for fast computation. Experimental results show that the proposed detection method is better than the previous detection methods, especially the testing dataset is the real-world dataset.</details>

**_An Adaptive Sliding Window Algorithm for Mining Frequent Itemsets in Computer Forensics_**

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Data mining technology is widely utilized in the field of computer criminal forensics. The research of data mining technologies, such as frequent itemset mining, clustering etc., can effectively improve the efficiency of computer forensics. However, data items of streaming data are dynamically changed along with time, which triggers off some new challenges to computer forensics. To address this issue, this paper presents an adaptive sliding window based strategy for mining the main frequent itemsets on streaming data. The key idea is to dynamically adjust the size of sliding window by exploiting the time-varying feature of streaming data, in order to satisfy the concept change that occurs in the streaming data. The experimental results show that compared with the previous work, the proposed algorithm can superiorly adapt to the time-varying feature of streaming data, and dramatically enhance time performance by reducing the data size for mining.</details>

**_Towards Privacy-Preserving Forensic Analysis for Time-Series Medical Data_**  
Liu, X.; Yuan, X.; Liu, J.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Electronic medical record (EMR) forensics is at the forefront of both academia and industry, and has dominated increasingly important role in the fast revolutionized digital forensics area. Upon the severe financial loss and user privacy revealing caused by data breaches, protecting the forensic medical records only being mined by authorized investigators and data confidentiality is deemed essential. Standard encryption technique can ensure the end-to-end data security, yet restricting the functionality in forensic analyzing. How to proceed similarity match over forensic physiological data in a private manner is intrinsically challenging, because the natural properties of such medical data are high-dimensional and times series related. In this paper, we propose a secure framework to proceed similarity match over encrypted physiological time-series data. Our framework resorts to an advanced similarity search algorithm, aka stratified locality-sensitive hashing (SLSH) to assist an authorized forensic investigator to have in-depth understanding of physiological data with multiple perspectives. In addition, our framework adopts a scalable encrypted index construction which provides provable security guarantees. Finally, we give a discussion of our future work based on this framework. As a generic and scalable framework, our design can be easily extended to secure update and parallel processing.</details>

**_Deduplicated Disk Image Evidence Acquisition and Forensically-Sound Reconstruction_**  
Du, X.; Ledwith, P.; Scanlon, M.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The ever-growing backlog of digital evidence waiting for analysis has become a significant issue for law enforcement agencies throughout the world. This is due to an increase in the number of cases requiring digital forensic analysis coupled with the increasing volume of data to process per case. This has created a demand for a paradigm shift in the method that evidence is acquired, stored, and analyzed. The ultimate goal of the research presented in this paper is to revolutionize the current digital forensic process through the leveraging of centralized deduplicated acquisition and processing approach. Focusing on this first step in digital evidence processing, acquisition, a system is presented enabling deduplicated evidence acquisition with the capability of automated, forensically-sound complete disk image reconstruction. As the number of cases acquired by the proposed system increases, the more duplicate artifacts will be encountered, and the more efficient the processing of each new case will become. This results in a time saving for digital investigators, and provides a platform to enable non-expert evidence processing, alongside the benefits of reduced storage and bandwidth requirements.</details>

**_Towards Malware Detection via CPU Power Consumption: Data Collection Design and Analytics_**  
Bridges, R.; Jiménez, J. Hernández; Nichols, J.; Goseva-Popstojanova, K.; Prowell, S.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>This paper presents an experimental design and algorithm for power-based malware detection on general-purpose computers. Our design allows programmatic collection of CPU power profiles for a fixed set of non-malicious benchmarks, first running in an uninfected state and then in an infected state with malware running along with non-malicious software. To characterize power consumption profiles, we use both simple statistical and novel, sophisticated features. We propose an unsupervised, one-class anomaly detection ensemble and compare its perfor-mance with several supervised, kernel-based SVM classifiers (trained on clean and infected profiles) in detecting previously unseen malware. The anomaly detection system exhibits perfect detection when using all features across all benchmarks, with smaller false detection rate than the supervised classifiers. This paper provides a proof of concept that power-based malware detection is feasible for general-purpose computers and presents several future research steps toward that goal.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The emerging embedded systems, which account for a wide range of applications are often highly resource-constrained challenging the conventional software-based methods traditionally deployed for detecting and containing malware in general purpose computing systems. In addition to the complexity and cost (computing and storage), the software-based malware detection methods mostly rely on the static signature analysis of the running programs, requiring continuous software update in the field to remain accurate in capturing emerging malware, which is not affordable for embedded systems with limited computing and communication bandwidth. Hardware-assisted Malware Detection (HMD) though found to be more efficient, limited computing power and resources in embedded systems as well as the small number of available Hardware Performance Counter (HPC) registers that can be simultaneously captured, make accurate runtime malware detection in embedded devices a challenging problem. In response, this work proposes a lightweight customized HMD approach which takes advantage of HPC features to effectively detect and further classify various malware classes at runtime. To realize a runtime solution that relies on limited available HPCs and to enhance the accuracy of malware detection, we use customized HMD for individual class of malware that utilizes various Machine Learning (ML) classifiers to detect malware using the four most important HPC features.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Blockchain is the shared distributed ledger to record the history of transactions. In blockchain network, nodes validate the transactions and reach the consensus on the ordered transactions. The more transactions are happened, the more processing powers of nodes are needed. Shard is introduced to blockchain for processing the multiple transactions in parallel. In this paper, we propose the blockchain for a domain based static sharding. We split a blockchain into multiple shards based on the domain. In each shard, nodes validate the multiple transactions concurrently and keep the shard's ledger separately. With this, it can be processing of low-latency transaction. Also, by changing the composition of committee members that validate blocks dynamically, we can enable the blockchain to be more trust.</details>

**_A Practical Machine Learning Approach for Dynamic Stock Recommendation_**  
Yang, H.; Liu, X.; Wu, Q.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Stock recommendation is vital to investment companies and investors. However, no single stock selection strategy will always win while analysts may not have enough time to check all S&P 500 stocks (the Standard & Poor's 500). In this paper, we propose a practical scheme that recommends stocks from S&P 500 using machine learning. Our basic idea is to buy and hold the top 20% stocks dynamically. First, we select representative stock indicators with good explanatory power. Secondly, we take five frequently used machine learning methods, including linear regression, ridge regression, stepwise regression, random forest and generalized boosted regression, to model stock indicators and quarterly log-return in a rolling window. Thirdly, we choose the model with the lowest Mean Square Error in each period to rank stocks. Finally, we test the selected stocks by conducting portfolio allocation methods such as equally weighted, mean-variance, and minimum-variance. Our empirical results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the long-only strategy on the S&P 500 index in terms of Sharpe ratio and cumulative returns.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this paper, we focus on the efficiency improvement of the content distribution network while endow this framework with controllability, where CHs(Content Helpers) have restricted distribution scope and thus the economic benefits of CP(Content Provider) are protected. We propose a novel controllable content distribution framework by using the blockchain technology as well as the iterative self organizing data analysis techniques algorithm (ISODATA), which is an improved k-means clustering method. To implement an incentive and consensus mechanism utilizing proof-of-stake, we employ smart contract to enforce content distribution in an autonomous way. We conduct some experiments to verify the validity and feasibility of the proposed framework. The experimental results demonstrated show that our framework has the advantages of high efficiency, low latency, and good scalability.</details>

**_A Novel Method for Detecting Image Forgery Based on Convolutional Neural Network_**  
Huang, N.; He, J.; Zhu, N.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Detection of image forgery is an important part of digital forensics and has attracted a lot of attention in the past few years. Previous research has examined residual pattern noise, wavelet transform and statistics, image pixel value histogram and other features of images to authenticate the primordial nature. With the development of neural network technologies, some effort has recently applied convolutional neural networks to detecting image forgery to achieve high-level image representation. This paper proposes to build a convolutional neural network different from the related work in which we try to understand extracted features from each convolutional layer and detect different types of image tampering through automatic feature learning. The proposed network involves five convolutional layers, two full-connected layers and a Softmax classifier. Our experiment has utilized CASIA v1.0, a public image set that contains authentic images and splicing images, and its further reformed versions containing retouching images and re-compressing images as the training data. Experimental results can clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed network.</details>

**_Forensic Analysis of Wear Leveling on Solid-State Media_**  
Neyaz, A.; Shashidhar, N.; Karabiyik, U.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Traditional hard drives are slowly becoming things of the past as newer technologies are constantly demanding lighter, faster, and more reliable alternatives. Solid-state media have started to permeate the market in an effort to satisfy this demand. Some tech giants have already started to use solid-state media in their products but are facing substantial price and storage capacity penalties. When it comes to performing forensic analysis on these solid-state media, the autonomous behavior of the media does not look promising as it has serious reliability issues compared to traditional media. With wear-leveling always enabled, the persistence of deleted data is always in question. The deleted data can stay on the media either partially or wholly and is dependent on various factors like the file system used on the media, capacity, manufacturer, software level TRIM functionality and also on the type of the operating system used. In this research, we analyzed different types of flash and solid-state media by filling them up with different types of files an conducted exhaustive experiments to identify the probability of recovering and file-carving once these files are deleted. The aim of this paper is to give a detailed analysis that will provide a benchmark for digital forensics investigators who are constantly troubled by the thought of analyzing solid-state media.</details>

**_Providing Context-Aware Security for IoT Environments Through Context Sharing Feature_**  
Matos, E. de; Tiburski, R. T.; Amaral, L. A.; Hessel, F.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Nowadays security and privacy in Internet of Things (IoT) environments is a real issue. Traditional security mechanisms use a non-aware approach, in which static parameters are used to provide secure decisions. IoT is a dynamic environment. Thus a non-static approach for security provision becomes mandatory. Context-aware security appears as a viable choice for this kind of processing. It uses the context information of IoT environments thus providing dynamic security. When together with context sharing feature, it can add new dimensions to the IoT security. Context sharing allows the use of off-domain context information to the security provision. This paper defines an EdgeCentric Context Sharing Architecture that provides context-aware security by using shared context information. Moreover, we discuss the challenges in the context-aware security area.</details>

**_Securing Insulin Pump System Using Deep Learning and Gesture Recognition_**  
Ahmad, U.; Song, H.; Bilal, A.; Saleem, S.; Ullah, A.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Modern medical devices are equipped with radio communication chips enabling medical practitioners to remotely and continuously monitor patient's health. The conjunction of these medical devices with the radio communication chips and their internet connectivity exposes them to security and privacy risks. The insulin pump system is an autonomous, wearable external device, commonly used by diabetic patients to take insulin efficiently, as compared to manual injection through a syringe. Security attacks may disrupt the working of insulin pump system by delivering the lethal dose to patients and endanger their lives. In this paper, we ensure the correct dosing process of insulin pump system based on the combination of deep learning model and gestures performed by the patient. Specifically, we used Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network to predict the thresh hold value of insulin based on last three months log of insulin pump system. If the amount of insulin to be injected by the insulin pump system is greater than our predicted thresh hold amount, then our system asks the patient to perform the gesture. After successful recognition of the patient's gesture, our solution compares the suspicious value of insulin with patient's gesture and identifies an attack.</details>

**_Reducing Traffic Congestion for Machine to Machine Type Communication Over 4G-LTE Network by Decreasing Total Bytes Transmitted_**  
Joseph, J.; Ruhl, R.; Samuel, H.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In the near future, with the development of Machine to Machine (M2M) communication service providers may see a spike in traffic degrading the quality of service (QoS). With the addition of several M2M devices, it is expected to create conditions for overload in the Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core Network in 3GPP LTE networks. There are many studies that examine various characteristics of M2M communication devices including protecting the physical devices, authentication methods, congestion controls, privacy protection and many others. However, congestion will be a persistent problem with the increased devices and is the focus of this paper. There is research on the methods to control congestion, though this paper is considering increasing availability through reducing total bytes transmitted and thus avoiding or reducing overload and congestion in LTE network. In this paper, we have proposed and tested various optimizing mechanisms for reducing the signalling traffic and bandwidth utilization, thus decreasing the overload in the LTE architecture.</details>

**_A Public Key Based EDNS Privacy Tunnel for DNS_**  
Pan, L.; Yuchi, X.; Wang, J.; Hu, A.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>DNS privacy concerns are rising. DNS queries are sent in plain text by default, attackers can perform massive surveillance of unencrypted DNS traffic. Recursive resolvers know about the query domain name and the client IP address, which allows for fingerprinting of individual users. In order to mitigate privacy leaks in DNS, in this paper we propose a public key based EDNS Privacy Tunnel (EPT) padding option for DNS. EPT takes advantage of the public key encryption to hide the query domain name from recursive resolvers, reduce the client IP address leakage to authoritative servers, and defense against censorship and lying recursive resolvers.</details>

**_Anomaly-Based Network Intrusion Detection Model Using Deep Learning in Airports_**  
Sezari, B.; Möller, D. P. F.; Deutschmann, A.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The number of cyber-attacks are growing quickly and we are encountering modern and complex network intrusion attacks everyday even in secure computer networks. Last year, many airports in different countries were under attack of multiple network intrusions in various cyber-segments especially Information and Communication Technology (ICT) system (e.g. Ransomware attacks). Such cyber-attacks could happen again in much more destructive ways which can cause irreparable losses, and endanger human life by disruption and corruption of the airport ICT system. We are approaching an anomaly-based Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using deep learning which provides a normal system behavior model and detects an abnormal behavior. In other words, this model is designed to detect not only known network intrusion attacks, but also unknown and modern attacks. We have trained and tested our model with DARPA dataset used in KDD 1999 Cup. Our model achieved an outstanding result with highly accurate detection rate, also low false alarm rate, which is superior to the previous researches conducted on this dataset.</details>

**_Towards Dynamic and Optimal Big Data Placement_**  
Kritikos, K.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Nowadays, data are being produced at a very fast pace. This leads to the generation of big data that need to be properly managed, especially due to the increased complexity that their size introduces. Such data are usually subject to further processing to obtain added-value knowledge out of them. Current systems seem to focus more on how to more optimally perform this processing while they neglect that data placement can have a tremendous effect on the processing performance. In this respect, big data placement algorithms have been already proposed. However, most of them are either suggested in isolation to the big data processing system or are not dynamic to deal with required big data placement changes at runtime. As such, this paper proposes a novel, dynamic big data placement algorithm which can more optimally find the best placement solution by considering multiple optimisation objectives and solving in a more precise manner the big data placement problem with respect to the state-of-the-art. Further, a novel suggestion for optimally combining such an algorithm with a big data application management system is proposed so as to have the ability to address in conjunction both big data placement, processing and resource management issues. Respective experimental evaluation results showcase the efficiency of our algorithm in producing optimal big data placement solutions.</details>

**_Effective Integration of Geotagged, Ancilliary Longitudinal Survey Datasets to Improve Adulthood Obesity Predictive Models_**  
Mitra, S.; Qiu, Y.; Moss, H.; Li, K.; Pallickara, S. L.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Obesity is a critical health issue world-wide and has been identified as a leading cause of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes, stroke and certain types of cancer. In 2014, 1.9 billion adults were overweight and 600 million were obese. In this study, to facilitate early detection of childhood obesity, we present our methodology for effective data integration that allows modelers to import new attributes from auxiliary datasets using geospatial proximity, alongside the associated data uncertainty for each data point that is caused by the data aggregation process while estimating that attribute. We have used the data uncertainty estimate as input to various machine learning algorithms, to improve on the obesity prediction. As a case study, we have integrated the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 dataset with the US Census 2000 dataset and the 2000 CDC Growth Charts dataset to augment our prediction model with behavioral and environmental features. Compared to models with only biometric attributes, our empirical experiments show accuracy improvements when we incrementally consider behavioral aspects (8.9 10.2%), environmental aspects (12.1 12.3%) and data uncertainty estimates (18.3 25.6%).</details>

**_On MapReduce Scheduling in Hadoop Yarn on Heterogeneous Clusters_**  
Wang, M.; Wu, C. Q.; Cao, H.; Liu, Y.; Wang, Y.; Hou, A.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Hadoop is a distributed computing system widely used for big data processing in various domains. As the data volume continues to increase rapidly, Hadoop systems have become a critical contributor to the success of many big data applications. The MapReduce scheduler is a key component that determines the overall performance of a Hadoop cluster. In this paper, we formulate and investigate a task scheduling problem in a heterogeneous Hadoop cluster to minimize the completion time of a batch of MapReduce jobs. We first design a prediction model to predict the end time of a task, which is used for placing the corresponding data block on a node in advance to reduce the data transmission time and the overall job completion time. Based on this prediction model, we propose a task matching-based scheduling algorithm, referred to as TMSA, to schedule the tasks in the task queue in Hadoop, by taking into account the real-time performance of each node in the cluster and the matching degree between nodes and tasks. Experimental results show that the prediction model achieves high accuracy and TMSA significantly reduces the completion time of a batch of MapReduce jobs compared to existing schedulers.</details>

**_Towards a Multi-model Cloud Workflow Resource Monitoring, Adaptation, and Prediction_**  
Serhani, M. A.; Kassabi, H. T. El; Qirim, N. Al; Navaz, A. N.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Workflow configuration, re-configuration execution, monitoring and adaptation over a cloud environment are considered very challenging activities. This is due to the fact that such activities are resource-aware, require intensive processing, and should adapt to dynamic cloud changes. In this research, we propose a multi-model for workflow resource monitoring, resource prediction, and resource adaptations. Three adaptation strategies are proposed to capture changes in environment resources, categorize various violations and take the necessary actions to adapt resources according to workflow needs. Workflow resource prediction uses ARIMA to predict resource shortage and support adequate adaptation. However, extreme adaptation is supported by continuously monitoring various workflow environment entities. We also evaluate workflow trust based on QoS to support the different adaptations strategies. We implemented our model on a cloud environment and we experimented different adaptation scenarios. The results validated the effectiveness of our monitoring, prediction and adaptation schemes in detecting violations and hence, predicting accurately cloud resource shortages and takes the appropriate actions to deal with these violations.</details>

**_Emotion Artificial Intelligence Derived from Ensemble Learning_**  
Bari, A.; Saatcioglu, G.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>We present in this work a predictive analytics framework that can computationally identify and categorize opinions expressed in text to discover and analyze attitudes towards a particular topic or product. We provide a new approach based on an ensemble model of three widely used sentiment analysis algorithms: TextBlob, OpinionFinder and Stanford NLP. In this work we investigated the performance of these latter algorithms on large, real datasets. Then, we designed two ensembles (1) one based on multivariate regression that computes a final prediction from three classification algorithms and (2) an ensemble that is based on majority rule. We computed the accuracy of the ensemble framework on labeled real datasets used in the literature that include tweets, as well as Amazon, Yelp and IMDb movie reviews. Our experiments indicated that the ensemble algorithms outperformed all three sentiment algorithms. The ensemble learning algorithm draws from the strengths of the individual sentiment algorithms, avoiding the need to select just one algorithm, creating a stronger tool for harnessing Emotion AI. This approach creates promises beyond the tweets and reviews analyzed here and can potentially be applied to marketing, finance, politics, and beyond.</details>

**_AMI Smart Meter Big Data Analytics for Time Series of Electricity Consumption_**  
Mohammad, R.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>AMI Smart meters are the advanced meters capable of measuring customer energy consumption at a fine grained time interval, e.g., every 5 minutes, 15 minutes etc. The data are very sizable, and might be from different sources, along with the other social-economic metrics, which make the data management very complex. A smart grid is an intelligent electricity grid that optimizes the generation, distribution and consumption of electricity through the introduction of Information and Communication Technologies on the electricity grid. Deployment of smart grids gives space to an occurrence of new methods of machine learning and data analysis. Smart grids can contain a millions of smart meters, which produce a large amount of data of electricity consumption (long time series). Big Data technologies offers suitable solutions for utilities. This paper presents a thorough analysis of 5-minutes 100 anonymized commercial buildings meter data sets to explore time series of electricity consumption and on the creation of a simple forecast model, which uses similar day approach. Our big data analytics can help energy companies to improve the management of energy and services, support intelligent grid control, make an accurate forecast or to detect anomalies.</details>

**_An Effective Method to Generate Simulated Attack Data Based on Generative Adversarial Nets_**  
Xie, H.; Lv, K.; Hu, C.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In practice, there are few available attack dataset. Although there are many methods that can be used to simulate cyberattacks for attack data, such as using specific tools, writing scripts to simulate the attack scenes, etc.. The disadvantages of those methods are also obvious. Tools developers and script authors need to know professional network security knowledge. As tools are implemented in different ways, users also need to have some expertise. What's more, it may take a long time to generate a large amount of attack data. In this paper, we present some of the existing network attack tools and proposed a method to generate attack data based on generative adversarial network. Using our method you do not need to have a professional network security knowledge, only use some basic network attack data one can generate a large number of attack data in a very short period of time. As network malicious activities become increasingly complex and diverse, network security analysts face serious challenges. Our method also can generate mixed features attack data by setting training data with different attack types. It has high performance. To test the performance of our method, we did a test and found that it took only 160 seconds to generate a million connection records in a PC with 3.7GHz, 4 core CPU and 8G memory.</details>

**_Prediction Algorithm Based on Weather Forecast for Energy-Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks_**  
Ren, H.; Guo, J.; Sun, L.; Han, C.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Solar energy is one of the effective solutions for the perpetual operation of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), but the harvesting of solar energy is highly random, and it is very important to predict the solar energy harvesting in advance. The existing prediction algorithm has better predictive effect in predicting the similar weather conditions in the region, but the accuracy of the prediction algorithm will be reduced when the weather in the prediction area drastic changes. In this paper, the study is about the influence of weather conditions on solar energy harvesting by introducing real-forecast weather into the prediction algorithm. Secondly, based on the Weather Conditions Moving Average (WCMA) algorithm, an efficient and reliable prediction algorithm, Real-Forecast Weather Moving Average (RWMA) is proposed. The algorithm adjusts the prediction result of the following slot according to the error of the harvesting amount of the preceding several slot. Experimental results show that the RWMA algorithm can also predict solar energy when weather drastic changes. Compared with the existing prediction algorithm, RWMA algorithm solves the problem that the weather change affects the prediction result, and the prediction performance is greatly improved.</details>

**_Large Scale and Parallel Sentiment Analysis Based on Label Propagation in Twitter Data_**  
Yang, Y.; Shafiq, M. O.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Sentiment analysis is a promising branch in natural language processing, but it becomes challenging when dealing with data from Twitter due to the big volume, rapidly changing language style and a lack of training data. As a result, it is difficult to utilize the traditional lexicon-based approach and supervised learning method for the problems mentioned above. In this paper, we propose the label propagation algorithm in order to solve the last two problems based on graph structure and apply GraphX, an API in Spark framework for graph parallel computing, to address the first problem. The results show that the label propagation algorithm is robust and scalable in our parallel implementation. Meanwhile, our approach which utilizes the lexicon and noisy label like emoticons outperform the baseline significantly. For the future works, we plan to test more algorithms in clusters and optimize the way of taking advantage of the social network by adding a community detection procedure before the classification to improve the accuracy.</details>

**_Improved Weighted Label Propagation Algorithm in Social Network Computing_**  
Zheng, Y.; Zhu, Y.; Song, S.; Xiong, P.; Cao, Z.; Hou, J.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Nowadays social networks play an important role in people's daily life, where community detection is essential for business as well as security applications. And weighted networks are gradually taking the dominance in social networks whose attributes of the connections can be recorded and accessed flexibly. As the classic community detection algorithm Label Propagation Algorithm(LPA) failed to handle weighted social networks, the Weighted Label Propagation Algorithm(WLPA) was proposed recently. However, the WLPA still exposes insufficient accuracy, and costly time complexity compared with the LPA. In this paper, we optimize the WLPA in accuracy and execution time by modifying the propagation intensity and order in the label propagation process. And the optimization methods are confirmed to be efficient both in theoretical analysis and experimental verification. Moreover, the specific functions of the optimization methods are discussed in detail during the experiment. By means of the optimized community detection algorithm, we manage to extract the useful information of the Twitter social network. We also make use of the network visualization tool to recognize the concrete network structure and validate the community detection result.</details>

**_Reducing Relational Database Performance Bottlenecks Using 3D XPoint Storage Technology_**  
Yang, J.; Lilja, D. J.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Relational database systems are data-intensive applications because of their heavy I/O workload during a query execution. With more and more data being generated, database sizes are increasing significantly. As a result, database systems incur a tremendous latency to return the query results back to the clients. Using the TPC-H benchmark program, this work explores several key issues that degrade database performance, including read amplification, inefficient use of temporary tables, and higher buffer pool cache miss rates. We show that when clients execute database queries on a conventional storage device, such as a solid-state disk (SSD), the extra I/O latency resulting from the above issues leads to bottlenecks that limit overall database performance. The availability of a new generation storage device, the Optane, which uses a new 3D cross-point technology, provides a feasible approach to accelerate the overall database performance. Processing database queries on this new device produces 1.5-8.3X improvement in the I/O response time, and 1.1-6.5X improvement in the total response time, compared to an SSD-based system.</details>

**_Let me Join Two Worlds! Analyzing the Integration of Web and Native Technologies in Hybrid Mobile Apps_**  
Pouryousef, S.; Rezaiee, M.; Chizari, A.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>We can notice that security problems of inappropriate integration of native and web technologies in hybrid mobile applications (apps) have been covered in the related state-of-the-art research. However, analyzing hybrid mobile apps' unique behaviors has been seldom addressed. In this paper, we explore the influence of native and web technologies integration in hybrid mobile apps on the generated profile of mobile applications. Specifically, we analyze the type of Security Sensitive APIs (SS-APIs) exposed to web content and identify the corresponding usage patterns by systematically tracking function-call-graphs of a large number of hybrid and native mobile apps. Our investigations indicate that the generated profiles for hybrid and native mobile apps are considerably different. Using our proposed tool, called Hybrid-scanner, for tracking and analyzing internal behaviors of hybrid mobile apps, we show that there is more trace of API calling for triggering a specific SS-API in a hybrid mobile app in comparison with Android native mobile apps. In addition, we have found that almost 40% of SS-APIs in hybrid mobile apps are invoked by third-party libraries, e.g. advertisement libraries. This knowledge, however, is crucial for designing appropriate malware detection or vulnerability mitigation strategies. Based on our results, we discuss two main approaches in Android malware analysis field and enumerate some suggestions which should be considered in order to successfully detect malicious behaviors in such new type of apps.</details>

**_VeraGreg: A Framework for Verifiable Privacy-Preserving Data Aggregation_**  
Klemsa, J.; Kencl, L.; Vaněk, T.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>A lot of effort has been made to devise a scheme for verifiable and privacy-preserving outsourcing of arbitrary computations. However, such schemes rely on Fully Homo-morphic Encryption which is still far from practical. In our work, we instead focus solely on encryption schemes with single homomorphic operation, in particular addition. We define a rigorous framework that gives the data originator a possibility to check what values have been incorporated within provided homomorphic aggregate. We also propose a practical scheme that instantiates this framework and prove that it achieves Indistinguishability under Non-Adaptive Chosen Ciphertext Attack (IND-CCA1). The definition of our framework led us further to a straightforward modification of the security notions of Non-Malleability (NM) and Adaptive Chosen Ciphertext Attack (CCA2). Our modification aims at preventing trivial breach which is by principle unavoidable for plain homomorphic encryption. With our enhancement, the notions of security can serve as a novel security goal for any future verifiable homomorphic schemes.</details>

The efforts to govern and manage security have not resulted in the value statement that has been desired. A critical look at literature reveals that the struggles with governance can be consolidated into three main topics: practitioners do not have guidance on how to implement security governance; security governance models and methods are failing to address the dynamic environment that security works within, and; there lacks a method to measure governance, alignment, and the proposed value that governance brings. This paper examines these issues in the literature, the gaps in the literature, and identifies opportunities to address these gaps.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The passive personnel detection based on Wi-Fi has the advantages of low cost and easy implementation, and can be better applied to elderly care and safety monitoring. In this paper, we propose a passive indoor personnel detection method based on Wi-Fi, which we call as FDF-PIHD (Frequency Domain Fingerprint-based Passive Indoor Human Detection). Through this method, fine-grained physical layer channel state information can be extracted to generate feature fingerprints so as to help determine the state in the scene by matching online fingerprints with off-line fingerprints. In order to improve accuracy, we combine the detection results of three receiving antennas to obtain the final test result. The experimental results show that the detection rate of our proposed scheme all reach above 90%, no matter whether the scene is human-free, stationary or moving human presence. Besides, it can not only detect whether there is a target indoor, but also determine the current state of the target.</details>

**_Model-Based Trust Assessment for Internet of Things Networks_**  
Adams, S.; Beling, P. A.; Greenspan, S.; Velez-Rojas, M.; Mankovski, S.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Trust in data collected by and passing through Internt of Things (IoT) networks is paramount. The quality of decisions made based on this collected data is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the data. Currently, most trust assessment methodologies assume that collected data follows a stationary Gaussian distribution. Often, a trust score is estimated based upon the deviation from this distribution. However, the underlying state of a system monitored by an IoT network can change over time, and the data collected from the network may not consistently follow a Gaussian distribution. Further, faults that occur within the estimated Gaussian distribution may go undetected. In this study, we present a model-based trust estimation system that allows for concept drift or distributions that can change over time. The presented methodology uses data-driven models to estimate the value of the data produced by a sensor using the data produced by the other sensors in the network. We assume that an untrustworthy piece of data falls in the tails of the residual distribution, and we use this concept to assign a trust score. The method is evaluated on a smart home data set consisting of temperature, humidity, and energy sensors.</details>

**_Check-ins and Photos: Spatiotemporal Correlation-Based Location Inference Attack and Defense in Location-Based Social Networks_**  
Shahid, A. R.; Pissinou, N.; Iyengar, S. S.; Makki, K.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) users' interaction is largely carried through check-ins and photo sharing. The study of location privacy issues with check-ins has yielded different Location Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms (LPPMs), including dummies to hide user's whereabouts in a set of dummy locations without using a trusted-third party(TTP). However, the impact of shared photos on location privacy is yet to be understood. Our experiment on real data from a LBSN reveals that, like the check-ins, the spatial distribution of shared photos can influence user's location privacy. In this paper, we propose an inference model based on spatial distribution of historical check-ins and photos, and show that it is possible to deduce user's location at a high accuracy through spatiotemporal analysis of multiple events, comprising check-ins and photos. In the process, we evaluate state-of-the-art dummy mechanisms with the proposed inference model to stress the limitation of existing LPPMs. Then, we design a LPPM, called photo-check, to protect user privacy in LBSN for both check-in and photos; and carry out the experiment with real data from Foursquare to show its effectiveness and efficacy.</details>

**_Blockchain for Fraud Prevention: A Work-History Fraud Prevention System_**  
Sarda, P.; Chowdhury, M. J. M.; Colman, A.; Kabir, M. A.; Han, J.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Current job recruitment process involves a good number of documentations. It is not uncommon for job applicants to misrepresent, overstate or falsify past employment, specifically work experience, and skills. Where this occurs and the applicant is subsequently appointed, a company may be exposed to significant commercial and legal risk. Companies usually employ third party HR recruitment agencies to verify the authenticity of an applicant's listed work experience. However, verification of applicant's past work experience is both time consuming and costly. Moreover, companies have to rely on the third parties, which may not be trustworthy. Therefore, small and medium size companies usually avoid the verification process. In this research, we demonstrate how blockchain technology can provide cost-effective, and real-time work history verification. The proposed approach also ensures trustworthy and privacy-preserving (work-history) data sharing. Furthermore, we have implemented a prototype to demonstrate how individuals can share and verify work history using Ethereum-based public blockchain.</details>

**_Using Artificial Neurons in Evidence Based Trust Computation_**

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>This paper proposes an alternative approach for evidence based trust computation where the relationship between evidence and trust is learned using an artificial neuron, making it possible to automatically adapt trust computation to different use cases. Computational trust aims to quantify trust based on ever increasing evidence on observations. In the literature a trust value is seen as a posterior subjective probability, computed using Bayesian inference on evidence, a prior and a weight of the prior. This provides a fixed mapping between evidence and trust, which may not be suitable for every case study, e.g. when positive and negative evidences are not equally important. The proposed solution is also a first step towards our future work to replace complex and case-specific trust fusion operators proposed in the literature with a generic case-independent artificial neural network solution. Our experiments on example cases of coin toss prediction and occupancy detection show that for sufficiently large data sets, i.e. given sufficient evidence based on a history of observations, the proposed learning approach yields comparable results and in some cases beats the existing approach.</details>

**_Intrusion-Resilient Classifier Approximation: From Wildcard Matching to Range Membership_**  
Crescenzo, G. Di; Bahler, L.; Coan, B.; Rohloff, K.; Polyakov, Y.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>We study the problem of securing machine learning classifiers against intrusion attacks (i.e., attacks that somehow retrieve the classifier model parameters). We show that efficient cryptographic program obfuscation techniques turn out to be a very useful tool to transform a (matching-type) classifier into one that is intrusion-resilient. Since not many efficient cryptographic program obfuscators exist in the literature, we investigate the task of classifier approximation. By proposing classifier approximations of conjunction of range membership classifiers based on wildcard matching, we construct non-trivial classifiers for image recognition tasks. The resulting classifiers, although limited in that they have to be selected within the small class of functions that have an efficient cryptographic obfuscator in the literature, can be used to achieve more than 90% quality of approximation (i.e., the ratio between the machine learning metric in the approximating classifier to the same metric for the original classifier), and keep their parameters obfuscated against an intruder when combined with known cryptographic program obfuscators.</details>

**_Hardware Trojan Detection Utilizing Machine Learning Approaches_**  
Hasegawa, K.; Shi, Y.; Togawa, N.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Hardware security has become a serious concern in recent years. Due to the outsourcing in hardware production, malicious circuits (or hardware Trojans) can be easily inserted into hardware products by attackers. Since hardware Trojans are tiny and stealthy, their detection is difficult. Under the circumstances, numerous hardware-Trojan detection methods have been proposed. In this paper, we elaborate the overview of hardware-Trojan detection and review the hardware-Trojan detection methods using machine learning which is one of the state-of-the-art approaches.</details>

**_Correlation-Based Electromagnetic Analysis Attack Using Haar Wavelet Reconstruction with Low-Pass Filtering on an FPGA Implementaion of AES_**  
Bu, A.; Dai, W.; Lu, M.; Cai, H.; Shan, W.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In recent years, side channel attacks (SCA) have become the most powerful method of stealing keys from cryptographic devices. This paper establishes a complete process of electromagnetic analysis attack based on correlation between energy traces and intermediate data in AES encryption algorithm. A novel method of preprocessing energy traces, which combines wavelet reconstruction with low-pass filtering, is proposed to enhance the capability to obtain correct key information of AES. Correlation-based power analysis attack (CPA) and electromagnetic analysis attack (CEMA) are implemented on the unprotected AES encryption circuit in the SAKURA-G FPGA board. The results clearly show that only 972 and 1069 energy traces are required to find all 16-byte keys. With only collecting 200 traces, CEMA presents more efficient attack capability than CPA. Thus, our proposed method is appropriate for obtaining key information of cryptographic devices.</details>

**_A New Wavelet Thresholding Method Based on Cyclostationarity for Enhancing the Interception of Computer Video Leakage Signals_**  
Shi, J.; Lv, B.; Li, Y.; Jia, Y.; Wang, R.; Liao, Y.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Computer displays emit electromagnetic waves, which leak the information displayed by the computers. Electromagnetic radiation signals from computer displays can be a security risk if they are intercepted and reconstructed. Signal to noise ratios (SNR) of video leakage signal are usually low due to the environmental noise and many other man-made noises. This can seriously influence the quality of the reconstructed image and further processing of video leakage signals. In this paper, a new cyclostationarity wavelet thresholding method is proposed for enhancing the interception of the video leakage signals by improving the SNR of signals. We analyzed the cyclostationarity property of computer video leakage signals, and then we used that property to improve the performance of wavelet thresholding method and the performance of preprocessing computer video leakage signals. We pre-process one-dimensional leakage signals without reconstructing the image in order to process signals more efficiently. At the same time, the performance of processing image can also be improved as long as the processed signal can be reconstructed to an image. The processed results of the actual experimental data show that the proposed algorithm performs better both on denoising one-dimensional signal and two-dimensinal reconstructed image than the other four wavelet thresholding methods which are Square-Root-Log, Minimax principle, Heursure and Rigrsure.</details>

**_Secure, Decentralized Energy Resource Management Using the Ethereum Blockchain_**  
DeCusatis, C.; Lotay, K.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>While blockchain services hold great promise to improve many different industries, there are significant cybersecurity concerns which must be addressed. In this paper, we investigate security considerations for an Ethereum blockchain hosting a distributed energy management application. We have simulated a microgrid with ten buildings in the northeast U.S., and results of the transaction distribution and electricity utilization are presented. We also present the effects on energy distribution when one or two smart meters have their identities corrupted. We then propose a new approach to digital identity management that would require smart meters to authenticate with the blockchain ledger and mitigate identity-spoofing attacks. Applications of this approach to defense against port scans and DDoS, attacks are also discussed.</details>

**_Research on Malicious Code Homology Analysis Method Based on Texture Fingerprint Clustering_**  
Xiaolin, Z.; Yiman, Z.; Xuhui, L.; Quanbao, C.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>In recent years, the number of malware and malicious code variants has increased dramatically, which results in serious problems in the network security field. However, the existing method is not accurate and efficient. In order to improve the method, we study and find that there are commonalities between the malicious software and image recognition. Therefore, we introduce the image feature extraction technology and propose a malicious code homology analysis method based on the texture fingerprint clustering. The binary malicious programs which are no source code can be visualized by this way, and the image texture fingerprint information be analyzed so that the type and family of malicious programs can be found more efficiently and accurately. In addition, this paper designs and implements a prototype experiment to verify the validity of the method. The results show that the malicious code homology analysis method based on the texture fingerprint clustering is effective and accurate to analyze the homology.</details>

**_Handling Capabilities in Security Policies_**  
Tolba, M.; Benferhat, S.; Tabia, K.; Belkhir, A.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Access control models are important tools that restrict information resources to only authorized users on the basis of some security policies. In existing access control models, security policies are defined over a set of elementary actions. The interaction between these actions has been rarely taken into account. This paper proposes an analysis of security policies that take into account dependence relations between actions using the concept of capability. We show how capabilities are used to construct a multi-level policies. Access control over action sequences are represented using deterministic finite automaton.</details>

**_On Mitigation Inefficiency of Selfish Investment in Network Recovery from High Loss SIS Infection_**  
Marbukh, V.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>This paper reports on quantification and mitigation of the inefficiency of selfish investment in network recovery from Susceptible Infected Susceptible (SIS) infection in a practically important case of high losses due to infection. In this case, both socially optimal and selfish investments in the infection loss mitigation keep the system close to the boundary of the infection-free region. However, our analysis reveals that while socially optimal investments result in asymptotically zero infection losses, this is not the case for selfish investments. The inefficiency of selfish investments, which is measured by the corresponding Price of Anarchy (PoA), is due to positive externalities. In heterogeneous networks, positive externalities result in finite infection losses despite aggregate overinvestment due to imbalances of selfish investments. While the infection losses can be eliminated with </details>

**_SecureCloud: An Encrypted, Scalable Storage for Cloud Forensics_**  
Uphoff, M.; Wander, M.; Weis, T.; Waltereit, M.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The amount of forensic data collected by governments is increasing rapidly. Public cloud providers could store this data for a lower price than government owned infrastructure ever could, but for privacy reasons such data must be encrypted before it is sent to a public cloud. In this paper we present our SecureCloud system which provides a secure, efficient and seamless way to store forensic data in cheap but untrusted cloud environments. The forensic tools, however, are still executed on premises of the government agency, because they need cleartext data. We analyze the performance of our system using Autopsy to show that the forensic tool runs only 19 percent slower when reading encrypted data from SecureCloud compared with reading the same data from a local file server.</details>

**_Digital Watermarking for Relational Database Security Using mRMR Based Binary Bat Algorithm_**  
Tufail, H.; Zafar, K.; Baig, R.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Publically available relational data without security protection may cause data protection issues. Watermarking facilitates solution for remote sharing of relational database by ensuring data integrity and security. In this research, a reversible watermarking for numerical relational database by using evolutionary technique has been proposed that ensure the integrity of underlying data and robustness of watermark. Moreover, mRMR based feature subset selection technique has been used to select attributes for implementation of watermark instead of watermarking whole database. Binary Bat algorithm has been used as constraints optimization technique for watermark creation. Experimental results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed technique against data tempering attacks. In case of alteration attacks, almost 70% data has been recovered, 50% in deletion attacks and 100% data is retrieved after insertion attacks. The watermarking based on evolutionary technique (WET) i.e., mRMR based Binary Bat Algorithm ensures the data accuracy and it is resilient against malicious attacks.</details>

**_Cybersecurity: An Analysis of the Protection Mechanisms in a Cloud-centered Environment_**  
Okonofua, H.; Rahman, S. S. M.
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The numerous threats and data exfiltration that has taken place in our network require that significant effort is made to ensure the safety of organizational data and equipment. The diverse nature of emerging technologies and bring your own devices (BYOD), smartphones and so on makes it challenging to efficiently secure the traditional networks. However, the popularity resulting from low-cost service offerings in cloud computing and the dispersed nature, the use of virtual machines in cloud networks makes it attractive and perhaps safer than the regular networks. There is a certain level of the layer of abstraction with cloud computing, such as community cloud, distributed or hidden identity and the lack of control makes it appear impenetrable. The key to cybersecurity is for the protection of information in computer systems to protect and guide the architectural structures that are used to support the system or database. The protection of information in computer systems requires that protection mechanisms should guide the architectural structures that are used to support the system or database.</details>
