**_I Did Not Accept That: Demonstrating Consent in Online Collection of Personal Data_**

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Privacy in online collection of personal data is currently a much debated topic considering, amongst other reasons, the incidents with well known digital organisations, such as social networks and, in Europe, the recent EU/GDPR regulation. Among other required practices, explicit and simply worded consent from individuals must be obtained before collecting and using personal information. Further, individuals must also be given detailed information about what, how and what for data is collected. Consent is typically obtained at the collection point and, at a single point in time (ignoring updates), associated with Privacy Policies or End-User Agreements. At any moment, both the user and the organization should be able to produce evidence of this consent. This proof should not be disputable which leads us to strong cryptographic properties.The problem we discuss is how to robustly demonstrate such consent was given. We adapt fair-exchange protocols to this particular problem and, upon an exchange of personal data, we are able to produce a cryptographic receipt of acceptance that any party can use to prove consent and elicit non-repudiation. We discuss two broad strategies: a pure peer-to-peer scheme and the use of a Trusted Third Party.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Due to the increased use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), several methods have been developed in order to create more attractive interaction environments, so that users’ interest on using services to be maintained. Gamification consists a method, aiming to increase users’ engagement by implementing game design elements in services that are not games [1]. While using all these services, users’ information is recorded and monitored. Except the importance of increasing the use of ICTs, it is crucial to ensure that users’ personal information will be protected. To achieve it, privacy issues should be considered by software developers during the design phase of a service, in parallel with the game design elements. Based on our previous research [2], it was identified that the relation between gamification and privacy has not been examined sufficiently. As a result, a detailed analysis was conducted. In this work, in order to examine this relation in existent services, a detailed description of gamified services in several sectors has been conducted. Afterwards, based on the results of the conducted research and the examination of existent gamified services, a metamodel is presented, which describes how each game element conflicts with privacy requirements. By using this metamodel, software developers will be able to identify which mechanisms should be implemented in such services, so that users’ privacy to be protected in parallel. The development of such services ensures the trust between users and them and consequently, users’ engagements will be increased [3].</details>

**_Decentralised and Collaborative Auditing of Workflows_**

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Workflows involve actions and decision making at the level of each participant. Trusted generation, collection and storage of evidence is fundamental for these systems to assert accountability in case of disputes. Ensuring the security of audit systems requires reliable protection of evidence in order to cope with its confidentiality, its integrity at generation and storage phases, as well as its availability. Collusion with an audit authority is a threat that can affect all these security aspects, and there is room for improvement in existent approaches that target this problem.This work presents an approach for workflow auditing which targets security challenges of collusion-related threats, covers different trust and confidentiality requirements, and offers flexible levels of scrutiny for reported events. It relies on participants verifying each other’s reported audit data, and introduces a secure mechanism to share encrypted audit trails with participants while protecting their confidentiality. We discuss the adequacy of our audit approach to produce reliable evidence despite possible collusion to destroy, tamper with, or hide evidence.</details>
