**_Enhancing Collaboration Between Security Analysts in Security Operations Centers_**  
Crémilleux, Damien; Bidan, Christophe; Majorczyk, Frédéic; Prigent, Nicolas
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Security Operations Centers (SOCs) collect data related to the information systems they protect and process it to detect suspicious activities. In this paper we explain how a SOC is organized, we highlight the current limitations of SOCs and their consequences regarding the performance of the detection service. We propose a new collaboration process to enhance the cooperation between security analysts in order to quickly process security events and define a better workflow that enables them to efficiently exchange feedback. Finally, we design a prototype corresponding to this new model.</details>

**_Outsourcing Signatures of Confidential Documents_**  
Chabanne, Hervé; Keuffer, Julien; Prouff, Emmanuel
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>We describe an industrial case study of the application of zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge techniques to enable a client to securely outsource the signature of a confidential document he owns to a digital signature provider. On the one hand, the client gets a valid standard signature of his confidential document while the signature provider learns nothing more from the document than its digest. On the other hand, the signature provider has the guarantee that the client was in possession of his message. We report implementation results to show the practicability of our ideas.</details>

**_A Prediction-Based Method for False Data Injection Attacks Detection in Industrial Control Systems_**  
Bayou, Lyes; Espes, David; Cuppens-Boulahia, Nora; Cuppens, Frédéric
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>False data Injection attacks is an important security issue in Industrial Control Systems (ICS). Indeed, this kind of attack based on the manipulation and the transmission of corrupted sensing data, can lead to harmful consequences such as disturbing the infrastructure functioning, interrupting it or more again causing its destruction (overheating of a nuclear reactor). In this paper, we propose an unsupervised machine learning approach for false data injection attack detection. It uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for building a prediction model of expected sensing data. These latter are compared to received values and an alert security is raised if these values differ significantly.</details>

**_On Consent in Online Social Networks: Privacy Impacts and Research Directions (Short Paper)_**  
Joyee De, Sourya; Imine, Abdessamad
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) recognizes data subject’s consent as a legitimate ground of data processing. At present, consent mechanisms in OSNs are either non-existent or not GDPR compliant. While the absence of consent means a lack of control of the OSN user (data subject) on his personal data, non-compliant consent mechanisms can give them a false sense of control, encouraging them to reveal more personal data than they would have otherwise. GDPR compliance is thus the only way to obtain meaningful consents, thereby protecting user privacy. In this paper, we discuss the characteristics of valid consent as per the GDPR, analyze the present status of consent in OSNs and propose some research directions to arrive at GDPR compliant consent models acceptable to users and OSN providers (data controller). We observe that evaluating privacy risks of consents to data processing activities can be an effective way to help users in their decision to give or refuse consents and hence is an important research direction.</details>

**_A Systematic Method to Describe and Identify Security Threats Based on Functional Requirements_**  
Wirtz, Roman; Heisel, Maritta
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Scenarios in which the security of software-based systems is harmed become more and more frequent. Such scenarios can lead to substantial damage, not only financially, but also in terms of loss of reputation. Hence, it is important to consider those threats to security already in the early stages of software development. However, it is non-trivial to identify all of them in a systematic manner. In particular, the knowledge about threats is not documented in a consistent manner. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System is a well known way to characterize vulnerabilities in a structured way. Our idea is to document threats in a similar way, using a template. A distinguishing feature of our approach is that we relate the threats to the envisaged functionality of the software. Our contribution is two-fold: first, we propose a general template to describe security threats that can be used in the early stages of software development. Second, we define a systematic and semi-automatic procedure to identify relevant threats for a software development project, taking the functionality of the software-to-be into account.</details>

**_An Empirical Study on the Comprehensibility of Graphical Security Risk Models Based on Sequence Diagrams_**  
Volden-Freberg, Vetle; Erdogan, Gencer
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>We report on an empirical study in which we evaluate the comprehensibility of graphical versus textual risk annotations in threat models based on sequence diagrams. The experiment was carried out on two separate groups where each group solved tasks related to either graphical or textual annotations. We also examined the efficiency of using these two annotations in terms of the average time each group spent per task. Our study reports that threat models with textual risk annotations are equally comprehensible to corresponding threat models with graphical risk annotations. With respect to efficiency, however, we found out that participants solving tasks related to the graphical annotations spent on average \(23\%\) less time per task.</details>

**_DSTC: DNS-Based Strict TLS Configurations_**  
Alashwali, Eman Salem; Szalachowski, Pawel
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Most TLS clients such as modern web browsers enforce coarse-grained TLS security configurations. They support legacy versions of the protocol that have known design weaknesses, and weak ciphersuites that provide fewer security guarantees (e.g. non Forward-Secrecy), mainly to provide backward compatibility. This opens doors to downgrade attacks, as is the case of the POODLE attack [18], which exploits the client’s silent fallback to downgrade the protocol version to exploit the legacy version’s flaws. To achieve a better balance between security and backward compatibility, we propose a DNS-based mechanism that enables TLS servers to advertise their support for the latest version of the protocol and strong ciphersuites (that provide Forward-Secrecy and Authenticated-Encryption simultaneously). This enables clients to consider prior knowledge about the servers’ TLS configurations to enforce a fine-grained TLS configurations policy. That is, the client enforces strict TLS configurations for connections going to the advertising servers, while enforcing default configurations for the rest of the connections. We implement and evaluate the proposed mechanism and show that it is feasible, and incurs minimal overhead. Furthermore, we conduct a TLS scan for the top 10,000 most visited websites globally, and show that most of the websites can benefit from our mechanism.</details>

**_A Certificate-Less Key Exchange Protocol for IoT_**  
Kome, Ivan Marco Lobe; Cuppens-Boulahia, Nora; Cuppens, Frédéric; Frey, Vincent
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a popular cryptographic algorithm that allows Internet protocols to agree on a shared key and negotiate a secure connection. It is used in many protocols including SSH, IPsec, SMTPS, and protocols that rely on TLS. In the Internet of Things (IoT), we cannot rely on the PKI architecture to secure communications due to the growing number of connected things. We are proposing to decentralize the encryption keys management while maintaining the property of authentication and secrecy. We use the ability of each node to build a private channel to create a shared key, safe from the eye of an attacker. Our solution provides a solution to build a certificate-less trusted ecosystem for IoT.</details>

**_Personalized, Browser-Based Visual Phishing Detection Based on Deep Learning_**  
Bartoli, Alberto; De Lorenzo, Andrea; Medvet, Eric; Tarlao, Fabiano
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Phishing defense mechanisms that are close to browsers and that do not rely on any forms of website reputation may be a powerful tool for combating phishing campaigns that are increasingly more targeted and last for increasingly shorter life spans. Browser-based phishing detectors that are specialized for a user-selected set of targeted web sites and that are based only on the overall visual appearance of a target could be a very effective tool in this respect. Approaches of this kind have not been very successful for several reasons, including the difficulty of coping with the large set of genuine pages encountered in normal browser usage without flooding the user with false positives. In this work we intend to investigate whether the power of modern deep learning methodologies for image classification may enable solutions that are more practical and effective. Our experimental assessment of a convolutional neural network resulted in very high classification accuracy for targeted sets of 15 websites (the largest size that we analyzed) even when immersed in a set of login pages taken from 100 websites.</details>

**_Are Third-Party Libraries Secure? A Software Library Checker for Java_**  
Viertel, Fabien Patrick; Kortum, Fabian; Wagner, Leif; Schneider, Kurt
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Nowadays, there are many software libraries for different purposes that are used by various projects. An application is only as secure as its weakest component; thus if an imported library includes a certain vulnerability, an application could get insecure. Therefore a widespread search for existing security flaws within used libraries is necessary. Big databases like the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) comprise reported security incidents and can be utilized to determine whether a software library is secure or not. This classification is a very time-consuming and exhausting task.We have developed a tool-based automated approach for supporting developers in this complex task through heuristics embedded in an eclipse plugin. Documented vulnerabilities stored in databases will be taken into consideration for the security classification of libraries. Weaknesses do not always entail the same consequences; a scoring that identifies the criticality oriented on their potential consequences is applied. In this paper, a method for the enrichment of knowledge containing vulnerability databases is considered.Our approach is focussing on the scope of software weaknesses, which are library reasoned and documented in vulnerability databases. The Java Library Checker was implemented as eclipse plugin for supporting developers to make potential insecure third-party libraries visible to them.</details>

**_Authenticated Quality of Service Aware Routing in Software Defined Networks_**  
Aytaç, Samet; Ermiş, Orhan; Çağlayan, Mehmet Ufuk; Alagöz, Fatih
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Quality of Service (QoS) aware routing is an ongoing and major problem for traditional networks since they are not able to manage network traffic for immense variety of users due to their inflexible and static architectures. Software Defined Networking (SDN) has emerged to remove these limitations by separating the control plane and the data plane to provide centralized control with the help of programmable controllers. Such improvements also make SDN more flexible than traditional networks in terms of achieving QoS-aware routing for large and medium sized networks. However, providing QoS-aware routing in SDN without using any security mechanism may become a challenging issue. For instance, malicious users in the network may escalate their privileges to monopolize resource utilization. The provision of an authentication mechanism that jointly works with QoS-aware routing is expected to solve the issue. In this paper, we propose an Authenticated QoS-Aware Routing (AQoSAR) for Software Defined Networks to determine routing paths of a single user and a group of users in an authenticated manner. AQoSAR consists of the authentication application and the routing application. In the authentication application, we employ Ciphertext Policy Attribute Based Encryption since it easily operates with huge variety of users by defining attributes such as QoS-aware routing metrics. In the routing application, we propose a routing approach based on a metric list rather than a single metric for determining the QoS level of users. To show the applicability of AQoSAR, the security analysis and the performance analysis are presented.</details>

**_Effectiveness and Impact Measurements of a Diversification Based Moving Target Defense_**  
Smine, Manel; Cuppens, Nora; Cuppens, Frédéric
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Moving Target Defense techniques have been proposed to increase uncertainty and apparent complexity for attackers. In this paper, we first study the related work on quantification effectiveness and the impact of a diversification based MTD techniques. Then, we propose a new model that relies mainly on the knowledge that the adversary has about the target system to compute the effectiveness and the impact and also to figure out the optimal MTD diversification of a target system.</details>

**_Privacy Preserving Data Offloading Based on Transformation_**  
Saharan, Shweta; Laxmi, Vijay; Singh Gaur, Manoj; Zemmari, Akka
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) provides a scalable solution for both storage and computation of data over the Cloud. Though offloading benefits the execution performance, it raises new challenges regarding security. Privacy leakage risks prevent users from sharing their private data with third-party services. State-of-the-art approaches used for secure data storage are cryptography based, having an overhead of key management as well as do not support computation on encrypted data on the cloud server. However, homomorphic techniques support computation on encrypted data and generate an encrypted result, are compute intensive and not advisable due to resource constraint nature of mobile devices. This paper proposes a light-weight technique for privacy-preserving data offloading to the mobile cloud servers supporting computation. Our technique offloads the data to multiple servers instead of a single server. We have performed the security analysis for correctness, secrecy and unknown shares using various similarity measures.</details>

**_Connection Dumping Vulnerability Affecting Bluetooth Availability_**  
Lounis, Karim; Zulkernine, Mohammad
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Over the last few years, Bluetooth technology has been deployed in millions of devices including laptops, watches, mobile phones, cars, printer, and many other devices. It has been rapidly adopted as a short-range wireless communication technology for different IoT applications such as smart cities, smart healthcare, and smart grids. Yet, little attention has been paid to Bluetooth security. In this paper, we report a new Bluetooth vulnerability, named connection dumping. We show that this vulnerability can be exploited to affect Bluetooth availability. We generate three attack scenarios which exploit the vulnerability to cause disconnection between Bluetooth devices. We also generate attack scenarios for Bluetooth role switching and connection deprivation. We demonstrate the occurrences of the attacks on Bluetooth devices made by various manufacturers, running different Bluetooth versions and operating systems, and recommend possible mitigations for them.</details>

**_Trust Evaluation Model for Attack Detection in Social Internet of Things_**  
Abdelghani, Wafa; Zayani, Corinne Amel; Amous, Ikram; Sèdes, Florence
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Social Internet of Things (SIoT) is a paradigm in which the Internet of Things (IoT) concept is fused with Social Networks for allowing both people and objects to interact in order to offer a variety of attractive services and applications. However, with this emerging paradigm, people feel wary and cautious. They worry about revealing their data and violating their privacy. Without trustworthy mechanisms to guarantee the reliability of user’s communications and interactions, the SIoT will not reach enough popularity to be considered as a cutting-edge technology. Accordingly, trust management becomes a major challenge to provide qualified services and improved security.Several works in the literature have dealed with this problem and have proposed different trust-models. Nevertheless, proposed models aim to rank the best nodes in the SIoT network. This does not allow to detect different types of attack or malicious nodes.Hence, we overcome these issues through proposing a new trust-evaluation model, able to detect malicious nodes, block and isolate them, in order to obtain a reliable and resilient system. For this, we propose new features to describe and quantify the different behaviors that operate in such system. We formalized and implemented a new function learned and built based on supervised learning, to analyze different features and distinguish malicious behavior from benign ones. Experimentation made on a real data set prove the resilience and the performance of our trust model.</details>

**_Optimal Distribution of Privacy Budget in Differential Privacy_**  
Bkakria, Anis; Tasidou, Aimilia; Cuppens-Boulahia, Nora; Cuppens, Frédéric; Bouattour, Fatma; Ben Fredj, Feten
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Privacy budget management plays an important role when applying differential privacy, as it sets an upper limit in the ability to utilise the private database. In this paper, we explore the possibility of extending the total allocated privacy budget, taking into consideration the data consumer characteristics and the data utilisation context. To this end, we first study the problem of privacy budget distribution in adaptive multi-data consumer differential privacy use cases. Then, we present an extension of the classic differential privacy formal model that allows taking into consideration data consumers’ information disclosure risk when distributing the privacy budget among them. Finally, we define a method that allows to optimally distribute a given privacy budget among a private database’s data consumers.</details>

**_RIICS: Risk Based IICS Segmentation Method_**  
Es-Salhi, Khaoula; Espes, David; Cuppens, Nora
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>Nowadays, one of the major challenges in industrial business world is integrating industrial control systems (ICS) with corporate systems (IT) and keeping the integrated system secured. Connecting this two totally different networks has numerous benefits and advantages, but introduces several security problems. Defense-in-depth is one of the most important security measures that should be applied to integrated ICS systems. This security technique consists essentially of “Segmentation” and “Segregation”. Segmentation of an integrated ICS may be based on various types of characteristics such as technical characteristics, business impact, risk levels or other requirements defined by the organization. This paper presents RIICS (Risk based IICS Segmentation) a new segmentation method that aims to simplify security zones identification by focusing on systems characteristics that are really relevant for segmentation especially technical industrial specificities and risk.</details>

**_Practical Security Exploits of the FlexRay In-Vehicle Communication Protocol_**  
Murvay, Pal-Stefan; Groza, Bogdan
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>The ever increasing number of electronic control units inside a car demanded more complex buses with higher bandwidth capacities. But even the more recently designed in-vehicle network protocols, e.g., FlexRay, were engineered in thse absence of security concerns and thus they are highly vulnerable to adversarial interventions. In this work, we study the FlexRay protocol specification to identify features that can be used to mount various attacks. The attacks exploit both the physical layer and the data-link layer of the protocol to discard messages from the bus, i.e., DoS attacks, or to spoof messages by inserting adversarial frames and later discarding the genuine frames. We illustrate the feasibility of these attacks on an experimental setup composed of several FlexRay nodes implemented on automotive-grade controllers. While these attacks may not be a surprise, recognizing them may be relevant in preventing potential future exploits.</details>
